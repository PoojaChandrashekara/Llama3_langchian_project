      "Good mental health and well-being are essential for all of us to lead fulfilling lives, to realize our full potential, to participate productively in our communities, and to demonstrate resilience in the face of stress and adversity.Likewise, mental health services are an essential component of health care and universal health coverage. Mental health has been identified as an area for accelerated implementation in WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). Yet, there remains much to be done to ensure all people achieve the highest standard of mental health and well-being. Action must be taken to address decades of inattention to and underdevelopment of mental health services and systems, human rights abuses and discrimination against people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities.This updated comprehensive mental health action plan, endorsed by the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly in decision WHA74(14), builds upon its predecessor, the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020, by including revised indicators and options for implementation as well as updated global targets. The plan retains the emphasis on a life-course approach and on actions to promote mental health and well-being for all, to prevent mental health conditions for those at-risk and to achieve universal coverage for mental health services.The original four major objectives remain unchanged: more effective leadership and governance for mental health;  the provision of comprehensive, integrated mental health and social care services in community-based settings; implementation of strategies for promotion and prevention; and strengthened information systems, evidence and research.Although the targets in this action plan are ambitious, the WHO Secretariat and Member States remain committed to reaching them. To do so, we must act together to address mental health needs, now and for the future – because there is no health without mental health.\n",

      "1Setting the scene\n",
      "01 In May 2012, the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA65.4 on the global burden of mental disorders and the need for a comprehensive, coordinated response from health and social sectors at the country level. It requested the Director-General, inter alia, to develop a comprehensive mental health action plan, in consultation with Member States, covering services, policies, legislation, plans, strategies and programmes.\n",
      "02 This comprehensive action plan has been elaborated through consultations with Member States, civil society and international partners. It takes a comprehensive and multisectoral approach, through coordinated services from the health and social sectors, with an emphasis on promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, care and recovery. It also sets out clear actions for Member States, the Secretariat and international, regional and national level partners, and proposes key indicators and targets that can be used to evaluate levels of implementation, progress and impact. The action plan has, at its core, the globally accepted principle that there is “no health without mental health.”\n",
      "03 The action plan has close conceptual and strategic links to other global action plans and strategies endorsed by the Health Assembly, including the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, the Global plan of action for workers’ health 2008–2017, the Action plan for the global strategy for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2008–2013, and the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2030. It also draws on WHO’s regional action plans and strategies for mental health and substance abuse that have been adopted or are being developed. The action plan has been designed to create synergy with other relevant programmes of organizations in the United Nations system, United Nations interagency groups and intergovernmental organizations.\n",
      "04 The action plan builds upon, but does not duplicate, the work of WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The focus of the latter was to expand services for mental health in low resource settings. The action plan is global in its scope and is designed to provide guidance for national action plans. It addresses, for all resource settings, the response of social and other relevant sectors, as well as promotion and prevention strategies.\n",
      "05 In this action plan, the term “mental disorders” is used to denote a range of mental and behavioural disorders that fall within the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth revision (ICD-10). These include disorders that cause a high burden of disease such as depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, dementia, substance use disorders, intellectual disabilities, and developmental and behavioural disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence, including autism. For dementia and substance use disorders, additional prevention strategies may also be required (as described, for example, in a WHO report on dementia issued in early 2012\n",
      "1 and in the Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol). Furthermore, the plan covers suicide prevention and many of the actions are also relevant to conditions such as epilepsy. The term “vulnerable groups” is used in the action plan to refer to individuals or groups of individuals who are made vulnerable by the situations and environments that they are exposed to (as opposed to any inherent weakness or lack of capacity). The term “vulnerable groups” should be applied within countries as appropriate to the national situation.\n",
      "06 The action plan also covers mental health, which is conceptualized as a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. With respect to children, an emphasis is placed on the developmental aspects, for instance, having a positive sense of identity, the ability to manage thoughts, emotions, as well as to build social relationships, and the aptitude to learn and to acquire an education, ultimately enabling their full active participation in society.\n",

      "-----------------\n",
      "Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030207 In the light of widespread human rights violations and discrimination experienced by people with mental disorders, a human rights perspective is essential in responding to the global burden of mental disorders. The action plan emphasizes the need for services, policies, legislation, plans, strategies and programmes to protect, promote and respect the rights of persons with mental disorders in line with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international and regional human rights instruments.\n",
      "Overview of the global situation\n",
      "08 Mental health is an integral part of health and well-being, as reflected in the definition of health in the Constitution of the World Health Organization: “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Mental health, like other aspects of health, can be affected by a range of socioeconomic factors (described below) that need to be addressed through comprehensive strategies for promotion, prevention, treatment and recovery in a whole-of-government approach.\n",
      "Mental health and disorders: determinants and consequences09\n",
      " Determinants of mental health and mental disorders include not only individual attributes such as the ability to manage one’s thoughts, emotions, behaviours and interactions with others, but also social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors such as national policies, social protection, living standards, working conditions, and community social supports. Exposure to adversity at a young age is an established preventable risk factor for mental disorders.\n",
      "10 Depending on the local context, certain individuals and groups in society may be placed at a significantly higher risk of experiencing mental health problems. These vulnerable groups may (but do not necessarily) include members of households living in poverty, people with chronic health conditions, infants and children exposed to maltreatment and neglect, adolescents first exposed to substance use, minority groups, indigenous populations, older people, people experiencing discrimination and human rights violations, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons, prisoners, and people exposed to conflict, natural disasters or other humanitarian emergencies. The current global financial crisis provides a powerful example of a macroeconomic factor leading to cuts in funding despite a concomitant need for more mental health and social services because of higher rates of mental disorders and suicide as well as the emergence of new vulnerable groups (for example, the young unemployed). In many societies, mental disorders related to marginalization and impoverishment, domestic violence and abuse, and overwork and stress are of growing concern, especially for women’s health.\n",
      "11 People with mental disorders experience disproportionately higher rates of disability and mortality. For example, persons with major depression and schizophrenia have a 40% to 60% greater chance of dying prematurely than the general population, owing to physical health problems that are often left unattended (such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and HIV infection) and suicide. Suicide is the second most common cause of death among young people worldwide.\n",
      "12 Mental disorders often affect, and are affected by, other diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and HIV infection/AIDS, and as such require common services and resource mobilization efforts. For example, there is evidence that depression predisposes people to myocardial infarction and diabetes, both of which conversely increase the likelihood of depression. Many risk factors such as low socioeconomic status, alcohol use and stress are common to both mental disorders and other noncommunicable diseases. There is also substantial concurrence of mental disorders and substance use disorders. Taken together, mental, neurological and substance use disorders exact a high toll, accounting for 13% of the total global burden \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "3Overview of the global situationof disease in the year 2004. Depression alone accounts for 4.3% of the global burden of disease and is among the largest single causes of disability worldwide (11% of all years lived with disability globally), particularly for women. The economic consequences of these health losses are equally large: a recent study estimated that the cumulative global impact of mental disorders in terms of lost economic output will amount to US$ 16.3 trillion between 2011 and 2030.1\n",
      "13 Mental disorders frequently lead individuals and families into poverty.2 Homelessness and inappropriate incarceration are far more common for people with mental disorders than for the general population and exacerbate their marginalization and vulnerability. Because of stigmatization and discrimination, persons with mental disorders often have their human rights violated and many are denied economic, social and cultural rights, with restrictions on the rights to work and education, as well as reproductive rights and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. They may also be subject to unhygienic and inhuman living conditions, physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and harmful and degrading treatment practices in health facilities. They are often denied civil and political rights such as the right to marry and found a family, personal liberty, the right to vote and to participate effectively and fully in public life, and the right to exercise their legal capacity on other issues affecting them, including their treatment and care. As such, persons with mental disorders often live in vulnerable situations and may be excluded and marginalized from society, which constitutes a significant impediment to the achievement of national and international development goals. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is binding on States Parties that have ratified or acceded to it, protects and promotes the rights of all persons with disabilities, including persons with mental and intellectual impairments, and also promotes their full inclusion in international cooperation including international development programmes.\n",
      "Health system resources and responses14\n",
      " Health systems have not yet adequately responded to the burden of mental disorders; as a consequence, the gap between the need for treatment and its provision is large all over the world. Between 76% and 85% of people with severe mental disorders receive no treatment for their disorder in low-income and middle-income countries; the corresponding range for high-income countries is also high: between 35% and 50%. A further compounding problem is the poor quality of care for those receiving treatment. WHO’s Mental Health Atlas 2011 provides data that demonstrate the scarcity of resources within countries to meet mental health needs, and underlines the inequitable distribution and inefficient use of such resources. Globally, for instance, annual spending on mental health is less than US$ 2 per person and less than US$ 0.25 per person in low-income countries, with 67% of these financial resources allocated to stand-alone mental hospitals, despite their association with poor health outcomes and human rights violations. Redirecting this funding towards community-based services, including the integration of mental health into general health care settings, and through maternal, sexual, reproductive and child health, HIV/AIDS and chronic noncommunicable disease programmes, would allow access to better and more cost-effective interventions for many more people.\n",
      "15 The number of specialized and general health workers dealing with mental health in low-income and middle-income countries is grossly insufficient. Almost half the world’s population lives in countries where, on average, there is one psychiatrist to serve 200 000 or more people; other mental health care providers who are trained in the use of psychosocial interventions are even scarcer. Similarly, a much higher proportion of high-income countries than low-income countries reports having a policy, plan and legislation on mental health; for instance, only 36% of people living in low-income countries are covered by mental health legislation compared with 92% in high-income countries.\n",

      "-----------------\n",
      "Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030416 Civil society movements for mental health in low-income and middle-income countries are not well developed.  Organizations of people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities are present in only 49% of low-income countries compared with 83% of high-income countries; for family associations the respective figures are 39% and 80%.\n",
      "17 Finally, the availability of basic medicines for mental disorders in primary health care is notably low (in comparison to medicines available for infectious diseases and even other noncommunicable diseases), and their use restricted because of the lack of qualified health workers with the appropriate authority to prescribe medications. In addition, the availability of non-pharmacological approaches and trained personnel to deliver these interventions is also lacking. Such factors act as important barriers to appropriate care for many persons with mental disorders.\n",
      "18 To improve the situation, and in addition to the data on mental health resources in countries (from WHO’s Mental Health Atlas 2011, as well as the more detailed profiling obtained through use of WHO’s assessment instrument for mental health systems),\n",
      "1 information is available on cost-effective and feasible mental health interventions that can be expanded to a larger scale to strengthen mental health care systems in countries. WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme, launched in 2008, uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand service provision in countries, especially in resource-poor settings. It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions and, importantly, directs its capacity-building towards non-specialized health care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care.\n",
      "19 The Secretariat has elaborated other technical tools and guidance in support of countries in developing comprehensive mental health policies, plans and laws that promote improved quality and availability of mental health care (such as the WHO mental health policy and service guidance package);\n",
      "2 in improving quality and respecting the rights of persons with mental disorders in health services (the WHO Quality Rights toolkit);\n",
      "3 and for disaster relief and post-disaster mental health system reconstruction (including the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Guidelines on mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings).\n",
      "4 Knowledge, information and technical tools are necessary but not sufficient; strong leadership, enhanced partnerships and the commitment of resources towards implementation are also required in order to move decisively from evidence to action and evaluation.\n",
      "Structure of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030\n",
      "20 The vision of the action plan is a world in which mental health is valued, promoted and protected, mental disorders are prevented and persons affected by these disorders are able to exercise the full range of human rights and to access high quality, culturally-appropriate health and social care in a timely way to promote recovery, in order to attain the highest possible level of health and participate fully in society and at work, free from stigmatization and discrimination.\n",
      "21 Its overall goal is to promote mental well-being, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human rights and reduce the mortality, morbidity and disability for persons with mental disorders.\n",

      "5Structure of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–203022 The action plan has the following objectives : 1. to strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health;2. to provide comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings;3. to implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health;4. to strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health.The global targets established for each objective provide the basis for measurable collective action and achievement by Member States towards global goals and should not negate the setting of more ambitious national targets, particularly for those countries that have already reached global ones. Indicators for measuring progress towards defined global targets are provided in Annex 1.\n",
      "23 The action plan relies on six cross-cutting principles  and approaches. 1. Universal health coverage. Regardless of age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation, and following the principle of equity, persons with mental disorders should be able to access, without the risk of impoverishing themselves, essential health and social services that enable them to achieve recovery and the highest attainable standard of health.2. Human rights. Mental health strategies, actions and interventions for treatment, prevention and promotion must be compliant with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other international and regional human rights instruments.3. Evidence-based practice. Mental health strategies and interventions for treatment, prevention and promotion need to be based on scientific evidence and/or best practice, taking cultural considerations into account.4. Life-course approach. Policies, plans and services for mental health need to take account of health and social needs at all stages of the life-course, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and older age.5. Multisectoral approach. A comprehensive and coordinated response for mental health requires partnership with multiple public sectors such as health, education, employment, judicial, housing, social and other relevant sectors as well as the private sector, as appropriate to the country situation.6. Empowerment of persons with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities. Persons with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities should be empowered and involved in mental health advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, monitoring, research and evaluation.\n",
      "24 The framework provided in this action plan needs to be adapted at regional level in order to take into account region-specific situations. The actions proposed for Member States are to be considered and adapted, as appropriate, to national priorities and specific national circumstances in order to accomplish the objectives. There is no blueprint action plan that fits all countries, as countries are at different stages in developing and implementing a comprehensive response in the area of mental health.\n",

      "Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–20306Proposed actions for Member States and international and national partners and actions for the Secretariat \n",
      "25 To achieve the plan’s stated vision, goal and objectives, specific actions are proposed for Member States and for international and national partners. In addition, actions for the Secretariat have been identified. Although actions are specified separately for each objective, many of these will also contribute to the attainment of the other objectives of the action plan. Some possible options to implement these actions are proposed in Annex 2.\n",
      "26 Effective implementation of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan will require actions by international, regional and national partners. These partners include but are not limited to:\n",
      "• development agencies including international multilateral agencies (for example, the World Bank and United Nations development agencies), regional agencies (for example, regional development banks), subregional intergovernmental agencies and bilateral development aid agencies;\n",
      "• academic and research institutions including the network of WHO collaborating centres for mental health, human rights and social determinants of health and other related networks, within developing and developed countries;\n",
      "• civil society, including organizations of persons with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities, service-user and other similar associations and organizations, family member and carer associations, mental health and other related nongovernmental organizations, community-based organizations, human rights-based organizations, faith-based organizations, development and mental health networks and associations of health care professionals and service providers.\n",
      "27 The roles of these three groups are often overlapping and can include multiple actions across the areas of governance, health and social care services, promotion and prevention in mental health, and information, evidence and research (see actions listed below). Country-based assessments of the needs and capacity of different partners will be essential to clarify the roles and actions of key stakeholder groups.\n",
      "Objective 1. To strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health28\n",
      " Planning, organizing and financing health systems is a complex undertaking involving multiple stakeholders and different administrative levels. As the ultimate guardian of a population’s mental health, governments have the lead responsibility to put in place appropriate institutional, legal, financing and service arrangements to ensure that needs are met and the mental health of the whole population is promoted.\n",
      "29 Governance is not just about government but extends to its relationship with nongovernmental organizations and civil society. A strong civil society, particularly organizations of people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities and families and carers, can help to create more effective and accountable policies, laws and services for mental health in a manner consistent with international and regional human rights instruments.\n",
      "30 Among the key factors for developing effective policies and plans addressing mental health are strong leadership and commitment by governments, involvement of relevant stakeholders, clear elaboration of areas for action, formulation of financially informed and evidence-based actions, explicit attention to equity, respect for the inherent dignity and human rights of people with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities and the protection of vulnerable and marginalized groups.\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "7Proposed actions for Member States and international and national partners and actions for the Secretariat  31 Responses will be stronger and more effective when mental health interventions are firmly integrated within the national health policy and plan. In addition, often it is necessary to develop a dedicated mental health policy and plan in order to provide more detailed direction.\n",
      "32 Mental health law, whether an independent legislative document or integrated into other health and capacity-related laws, should codify the key principles, values and objectives of policy for mental health, for example by establishing legal and oversight mechanisms to promote human rights and the development of accessible health and social services in the community.\n",
      "33 Policies, plans and laws for mental health should comply with obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other international and regional human rights conventions.\n",
      "34 The inclusion and mainstreaming of mental health issues more explicitly within other priority health programmes and partnerships (for instance, HIV/AIDS, women’s and children’s health, noncommunicable diseases and the global health work-force alliance), as well as within other relevant sectors’ policies and laws, for example, those dealing with education, employment, disability, the judicial system, human rights protection, social protection, poverty reduction and development, are important means of meeting the multidimensional requirements of mental health systems and should remain central to leadership efforts of governments to improve treatment services, prevent mental disorders and promote mental health.Global target 1.1: 80% of countries will have developed or updated their policy or plan for mental health in line with international and regional human rights instruments, by 2030.\n",

      "9Objective 2. To provide comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings48\n",
      " In the context of improving access to care and service quality, WHO recommends the development of comprehensive community-based mental health and social care services; the integration of mental health care and treatment into general hospitals and primary care; continuity of care between different providers and levels of the health system; effective collaboration between formal and informal care providers; and the promotion of self-care, for instance, through the use of electronic and mobile health technologies.\n",
      "49 Developing mental health services of good quality requires the use of evidence-based protocols and practices, including early intervention, incorporation of human rights principles, respect for individual autonomy and the protection of people’s dignity. Furthermore, health workers must not limit intervention to improving mental health but also attend to the physical health care needs of children, adolescents and adults with mental disorders, and vice versa, because of the high rates of co-morbid physical and mental health problems and associated risk factors, for example, high rates of tobacco consumption, that go unaddressed.\n",
      "50 Community-based service delivery for mental health needs to encompass a recovery-based approach that puts the emphasis on supporting individuals with mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities to achieve their own aspirations and goals. The core service requirements include: listening and responding to individuals’ understanding of their condition and what helps them to recover; working with people as equal partners in their care; offering choice of treatment and therapies, and in terms of who provides care; and the use of peer workers and supports, who provide each other with encouragement and a sense of belonging, in addition to their expertise. In addition, a multisectoral approach is required whereby services support individuals, at different stages of the life-course and, as appropriate, facilitate their access to human rights such as employment (including return-to-work programmes), housing and educational opportunities and participation in community activities, programmes and meaningful activities.\n",
      "51 More active involvement and support of service users in the reorganization, delivery and evaluation and monitoring of services is required so that care and treatment become more responsive to their needs. Greater collaboration with “informal” mental health care providers, including families, as well as religious leaders, faith healers, traditional healers, school teachers, police officers and local nongovernmental organizations, is also needed.\n",
      "52 Another essential requirement is for services to be responsive to the needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups in society, including socioeconomically disadvantaged families, people living with HIV/AIDS, women and children living with domestic violence, survivors of violence, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people, indigenous peoples, immigrants, asylum seekers, persons deprived of liberty and minority groups among others within the national context.\n",
      "53 When planning for humanitarian emergency response and recovery, it is crucial to ensure that mental health services and community psychosocial supports are widely available.\n",
      "54 Exposure to adverse life events or extreme stressors, such as natural disasters, isolated, repeated or continuing conflict and civil unrest or ongoing family and domestic violence, may have serious health and mental health consequences that require careful examination, particularly with regard to issues of diagnostic characterization (especially avoiding over-diagnosis and over-medicalization) and approaches to support, care and rehabilitation.\n",

For example, health workers trained in mental health should be equipped not only to manage mental disorders in the persons they see, but also to provide general wellness information and screening for related health conditions, including noncommunicable diseases and substance use. Not only does service integration require the acquisition of new knowledge and skills to identify, manage and refer people with mental disorders as appropriate, but also the re-definition of health workers’ roles and changes to the existing service culture and attitudes of general health workers, social workers, occupational therapists and other professional groups. Furthermore, in this context, the role of specialized mental health professionals needs to be expanded to encompass supervision and support of general health workers in providing mental health interventions.Global target 2.1:  Service coverage for mental health conditions will have increased at least by half, by 2030.Global target 2.2:  80% of countries will have doubled number of community-based mental health facilities, by 2030.Global target 2.3:  80% of countries will have integrated mental health into primary health care, by 2030.Proposed actions for Member States56\n",

Mental health evolves throughout the life-cycle. Therefore, governments have an important role in using information on risk and protective factors for mental health to put in place actions to prevent mental disorders and to protect and promote mental health at all stages of life. The early stages of life present a particularly important opportunity to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders, as up to 50% of mental disorders in adults begin before the age of 14 years. Children and adolescents with mental disorders should be provided with early intervention through evidence-based psychosocial and other non-pharmacological interventions based in the community, avoiding institutionalization and medicalization. Furthermore, interventions should respect the rights of children in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international and regional human rights instruments.Proposed actions for Member States and international and national partners and actions for the Secretariat  \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–20301270 Responsibility for promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders extends across all sectors and all government departments. This is because poor mental health is strongly influenced by a range of social and economic determinants including income level, employment status, education level, material standard of living, physical health status, family cohesion, discrimination, violations of human rights and exposure to adverse life events, including sexual violence, child abuse and neglect. Mental health needs of children and adolescents who are exposed to natural disasters or civil conflict and unrest, including those who have been associated with armed forces or armed groups, are very high and require special attention.\n",
      "71 Broad strategies for mental health promotion and the prevention of mental disorders across the life-course may focus on: antidiscrimination laws and information campaigns that redress the stigmatization and human rights violations all too commonly associated with mental disorders; promotion of the rights, opportunities and care of individuals with mental disorders; the nurturing of core individual attributes in the formative stages of life (such as early childhood programmes, life skills and sexuality education, programmes to support the development of safe, stable and nurturing relationships between children, their parents and carers); early intervention through identification, prevention and treatment of emotional or behavioural problems, especially in childhood and adolescence; provision of healthy living and working conditions (including work organizational improvements and evidence-based stress management schemes in the public as well as the private sector); protection programmes or community protection networks that tackle child abuse as well as other violence at domestic and community levels and social protection for the poor.\n",
      "1\n",
      "72 Suicide prevention is an important priority. Many people who attempt suicide come from vulnerable and marginalized groups. Moreover, young people and the elderly are among the most susceptible age groups to suicidal ideation and self-harm. Suicide rates tend to be underreported owing to weak surveillance systems, a misattribution of suicide to accidental deaths, as well as its criminalization in some countries. Nevertheless, most countries are showing either a stable or an increasing trend in the rate of suicide, while several others are showing long-term decreasing trends. As there are many risk factors associated with suicide beyond mental disorder, such as chronic pain or acute emotional distress, actions to prevent suicide must not only come from the health sector, but also from other sectors simultaneously. Reducing access to means to cause self-harm or commit suicide (including firearms, pesticides and availability of toxic medicines that can be used in overdoses), responsible reporting by the media, protecting persons at high risk of suicide and early identification and management of mental disorder and of suicidal behaviours can be effective.Global target 3.1: 80% of countries will have at least two functioning national, multisectoral mental health promotion  and prevention programmes, by 2030. Global target 3.2: The rate of suicide will be reduced by one-third, by 2030.Global target 3.3: 80% of countries will have a system in place for mental health and psychosocial preparedness for emergencies and/or disasters, by 2030.\n",

These data need to be disaggregated by sex and age and reflect the diverse needs of subpopulations, including individuals from geographically diverse communities (for instance, urban versus rural), and vulnerable populations. Data will need to be collected through ad hoc periodic surveys in addition to the data collected through the routine health information system.

      "when they disclose their experiences and understandings of different forms \n",
      "of emotional suffering. Mental distress can manifest in an extensive range of \n",
      "diagnosable mental disorders; the fifth and latest edition of the Diagnostic and \n",
      "Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM 5 ; American Psychiatric Association \n",
      "2013 ), an authority on the classification of mental disorders, comprises a hefty \n",
      "947 pages cataloguing 152 distinct psychiatric disorders (as well as various \n",
      "sub-types and unspecified disorders) ( McCarron 2013 ). In this book we bring \n",
      "together two different research programmes which focus on three mental \n",
      "disorders in particular: (i) the eating disorder, anorexia nervosa (henceforth, \n",
      "anorexia); (ii) the mood disorder, depression; and (iii) an emergent, contested \n",

      "to be comprehensive in its coverage of mental health conditions, its focus on \n",
      "these particular disorders does at least provide insight into two prominent \n",
      "types of mental distress – mood disorders and eating disorders – as well as a \n",
      "currently non-diagnosable condition in diabulimia. These three disorders also \n",
      "enable us to account for language used in relation to conditions that are marked, \n",
      "respectively, by their rate of mortality (anorexia), prevalence (depression) and \n",
      "questions over their diagnostic legitimacy (diabulimia). Although all of these \n",
      "disorders are subject to contestation (explored in more depth in the next \n",
      "chapter), the last of these in particular brings to the fore questions over how \n",
      "people come to describe – or resist describing – themselves as suffering from a \n",
      "medical condition, how other people respond to such descriptions and how this \n",
      "shapes their beliefs about themselves and what they are experiencing.\n",
      "-----------------\n",

      "Corpus, Discourse and Mental Health\n",
      "In the following chapters, then, we are interested in exploring the ways in which \n",
      "members of online health-related support groups use language and discourse (a \n",
      "concept we introduce later) to represent these conditions, as well as themselves \n",
      "and others in relation to them, in the messages that they write. Understanding \n",
      "the experiences, attitudes and beliefs held about anorexia, depression and \n",
      "diabulimia by people who live with them is crucial to understanding the \n",
      "conditions themselves and to evaluating how those who suffer from them can \n",
      "be best treated and supported. To this end, we believe that detailed analysis of \n",
      "the language used by people when talking about their mental health problems \n",
      "offers a potent means of making sense of these experiences, attitudes and beliefs.\n",
      "In this vein, a secondary aim of this book is to explore the opportunities \n",
      "and limitations of using corpus linguistic methods to analyse discourses of \n",
      "mental distress. The term corpus linguistics  refers to a body of methods that uses \n",
      "specialist computer programs to study linguistic patterns in large collections \n",
      "of naturally occurring language data ( McEnery and Wilson 2001 ). Corpus \n",
      "methods offer systematic means for pinpointing repeated and unique linguistic \n",
      "patterns in text and talk ( Baker 2006 ) and hence for identifying common and \n",
      "more singular representations of anorexia, depression and diabulimia in this \n",
      "book. For example, corpus software can rapidly retrieve and present every \n",
      "instance of depression  in a dataset and conduct statistical analyses based on the \n",
      "words that co-occur with it in order to understand how speakers typically (and \n",
      "atypically) talk about the condition and their relationship to it. Such affordances \n",
      "enable the mental health narratives of potentially thousands of individuals to \n",
      "be examined in ways that are not practical in purely qualitative studies. Despite \n",
      "the significant analytical opportunities offered by the ability to systematically \n",
      "analyse large amounts of data, to our knowledge there are few studies utilizing \n",
      "corpus techniques to examine online discussions of mental health issues (for \n",
      "exceptions, see Harvey 2012 , 2013a ; Harvey and Brown 2012 ; McDonald and \n",
      "Woodward-Kron 2016 ).\n",
      "While our analysis places strong emphasis on the lexical and grammatical \n",
      "features of online support group messages, our intention in this book is not \n",
      "to provide a purely descriptive account of these texts. Our reasons for this are \n",
      "twofold: first, linguistic descriptions of computer-mediated communication \n",
      "are not in short supply ( Baron 2000 , 2008 ; Crystal 2001 ; Barton and Lee 2013 ). \n",
      "Secondly, for their participants and, we believe, the social scientist, the primary \n",
      "significance of these online interactions does not lie in their status as neutral \n",
      "language data. Rather, it lies in the rich, first-hand accounts of mental health \n",
      "knowledge and experience which they provide. To present a purely descriptive \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "3\n",
      "Mental Health, Discourse and Corpus Linguistics\n",
      "account of these texts would therefore disregard an opportunity to understand \n",
      "the subjective accounts of pernicious mental health conditions that the \n",
      "participants offer. This practical orientation places the present study squarely \n",
      "in the tradition of applied linguistics, memorably defined by Brumfit ( 1995 : 27) \n",
      "as ‘the theoretical and empirical investigation of real-world problems in which \n",
      "language is a central issue’ (see also Cook 2003 ). To borrow Corder’s ( 1973 : 10) \n",
      "terms, our study ‘is not a theoretical study [but] makes use of the findings of \n",
      "theoretical studies’ to illuminate issues in the ‘real world’ . By its very nature, this \n",
      "makes applied linguistics an interdisciplinary endeavour, and the research in this \n",
      "book combines substantive aspects of linguistics, health sociology ( Nettleton \n",
      "2013 ) and medical humanities ( Crawford et al. 2015 ) and orients as much to the \n",
      "two latter disciplines as it does to the former.\n",
      "In keeping with this orientation, this book is intended for an audience drawn \n",
      "from a range of disciplinary backgrounds. In approaching questions about \n",
      "mental illness using methods from the field of linguistics, our intention is to \n",
      "show the value of attending closely to language even when dealing with issues \n",
      "more commonly associated with the disciplines of psychology and psychiatry. \n",
      "Likewise, attention to language can highlight the ways in which broad social \n",
      "changes are reproduced, negotiated and challenged at the micro level of \n",
      "interaction between individuals, and hence offer insights relevant to health \n",
      "sociologists.\n",
      "We should also make it clear at this point that it is not our aim to compare \n",
      "or contrast the discourses associated with anorexia, depression and diabulimia, \n",
      "although we do flag up certain areas of similarity or difference where these are \n",
      "judged to support (or likewise problematize) our analytical points. Neither is it \n",
      "our aim to establish a general set of ‘mental health discourses’ that characterize \n",
      "online mental health support discussions. It is for this reason that we analyse \n",
      "online interactions related to anorexia, depression and diabulimia separately in \n",
      "the form of three case studies, rather than amalgamating our data and focusing \n",
      "primarily on the consistencies across these conditions. By first considering the \n",
      "data related to anorexia, depression and diabulimia discretely, we are able to \n",
      "examine topics that are particular to interactions around each condition – such \n",
      "as insulin use in relation to diabulimia – but which would have likely slipped into \n",
      "the analytical background had we combined the datasets together. In addition, \n",
      "it also enables us to consider the ways in which the representations of anorexia, \n",
      "depression and diabulimia that emerge during interactions in each support \n",
      "group are strongly related to, and best understood in relation to, the contextual \n",
      "norms of each forum itself.\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "4\n",
      "Corpus, Discourse and Mental Health\n",
      "Finally, we should also make clear that it is not our intention to identify any \n",
      "‘linguistic markers’ of anorexia, depression, diabulimia or emotional distress \n",
      "more generally. Rather, we share the view of Galasiński ( 2008 ) who, writing in \n",
      "relation to depression, argues that the diverse ways in which people talk about \n",
      "emotional suffering means that it is ‘quite difficult to make definitive claims as to \n",
      "what affect in language is supposed to look like in depression or outside it’ (2008: \n",
      "16–17). This is a point we will return to in Section 1.4.\n",
      "In light of the interdisciplinary makeup of our intended readership, the \n",
      "remainder of this chapter elaborates on this general introduction with respect to \n",
      "the book’s three central elements: (i) mental health and distress, (ii) discourse, \n",
      "and (iii) corpus linguistics. The next section explores the constructed and \n",
      "contested nature of mental health and illness, a consideration which brings us to \n",
      "the phenomenon of medicalization – a key concept in this book’s analysis – and \n",
      "specifically to the processes by which some mental states come to be thought of \n",
      "and treated as ‘normal’ and others as ‘abnormal’ or ‘deviant’ and thus as requiring \n",
      "medical intervention. We then move on to the related topics of discourse and \n",
      "discourse analysis, sketching out the view of discourse we adopt in this book \n",
      "and the ontological assumptions this entails for our analysis. Following this, \n",
      "we provide a more detailed introduction to corpus linguistics as our primary \n",
      "methodology and approach to discourse analysis, acquainting readers with \n",
      "some of its key features and debates and comparing it against other approaches \n",
      "currently being applied in social scientific research of (mental) health language. \n",
      "The chapter then concludes with an overview of the remaining chapters of the \n",
      "book. Reflecting the diverse disciplinary perspectives from which the topic of \n",
      "mental health is approached in contemporary research, this book is written with \n",
      "a consciously interdisciplinary audience in mind. As such, we do not assume \n",
      "that readers have any prior knowledge of the topics of mental health and distress, \n",
      "discourse (analysis) or corpus linguistics.\n",
      "1.2 Mental health and the medicalization of distress\n",
      "An important starting point for the research in this book is our view of mental \n",
      "disorders as socially and discursively constituted. Epistemological debates \n",
      "around psychopathology have, as Pilgrim and Bentall (1999)  point out, long been \n",
      "characterized by two polarized positions which they term ‘medical naturalism’ \n",
      "and ‘social constructionism’ . Medical naturalism holds that psychiatric nosology \n",
      "‘proceeds incrementally with a confidence that there exists a real and invariant \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "5\n",
      "Mental Health, Discourse and Corpus Linguistics\n",
      "external world of natural disease entities’ (Pilgrim and Bentall 1999: 261). From \n",
      "this perspective, these ‘natural disease entities’ have been observed and studied by \n",
      "diagnosticians with increasing sophistication over time, rendering psychiatry’s \n",
      "accounts of mental disorders ever more accurate – in other words, bringing them \n",
      "ever closer to the ‘reality’ of the natural disease entities they aim to describe. \n",
      "However, the medical naturalism position has been challenged, most notably \n",
      "by proponents of anti-psychiatry, an international movement inspired by the \n",
      "work of scholars such as Michel Foucault, Ronald David Laing, Thomas Szasz \n",
      "and Franco Basaglia, that is concerned with reframing the concept of ‘mental \n",
      "health’ . Exponents of this movement problematize psychiatry’s explanatory and \n",
      "diagnostic frameworks, in many cases totally rejecting psychiatric explanations \n",
      "for mental distress ( Szasz 1960 ). Some critics of psychiatry also go so far as to \n",
      "claim that it has yet to provide any convincing evidence of the biological ‘reality’ \n",
      "of mental illness, such as lesions or physical defects in the brain ( Burstow 2015 ).\n",
      "The second perspective, social constructionism, studies psychiatric diagnoses \n",
      "as ‘representations of a variegated and ultimately unknowable human condition’ , \n",
      "with mental illnesses themselves viewed as ‘by-product[s] of the activity \n",
      "of mental health professionals’ (Pilgrim and Bentall 1999: 261). Influenced \n",
      "by the writing of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, scholars and critics \n",
      "working in the social constructionist tradition are less concerned with studying \n",
      "psychopathology itself and more interested in studying how psychopathology \n",
      "is represented or socially constructed through different types of social practice. \n",
      "The social constructionist perspective has been adopted by countless discourse-\n",
      "based and social scientific studies of mental illnesses including, among others, \n",
      "anorexia ( Hepworth 1999 ) and depression ( Lewis 1996 ) (see Harper (1995)  for a \n",

      "As the quote from Crowe alludes, as well as curtailing non-medical \n",

      "primary methodology and approach to discourse analysis.\n",
      "1.4 Corpus linguistics and alternative approaches\n",
      "Corpus linguistics is a collection of methods for analysing language based on \n",
      "large collections of naturally occurring language in-use (McEnery and Wilson \n",
      "2001). Such a collection of texts is called a corpus  (the Latin word for ‘body’ , \n",
      "plural corpora ). One of the main appeals of using large collections of data – it \n",
      "is not unusual for corpora to run into millions, sometimes billions, of words – \n",
      "is that it allows researchers to base their analyses on more substantial and \n",
      "representative textual evidence, thereby accounting for wider variation in the \n",
      "type of language or texts being analysed and ultimately producing findings that \n",
      "are more generalizable with respect to the particular language, social group, \n",
      "context or linguistic variety under study.\n",
      "A corpus is not a randomly compiled collection of texts but is carefully \n",
      "designed to represent a particular language or variety. Corpora can comprise \n",
      "textual data from a range of modes (i.e. speech, writing, computer-mediated \n",
      "communication, gestures) and genres (e.g. spoken conversations, books, \n",
      "online support groups). A corpus is considered representative of the variety it \n",
      "is designed to represent if findings based on its contents can be generalized to \n",
      "that variety ( Leech 1991 ). This issue of representativeness will therefore dictate \n",
      "the design of the corpus in terms of its size, the texts it contains and its balance \n",
      "in terms of how much each text or genre contributes to the corpus as a whole \n",
      "(McEnery and Hardie 2012 : 8–11).\n",
      "To illustrate how representativeness influences corpus design, it is useful to \n",
      "consider the distinction between general and specialized corpora. Where general \n",
      "corpora are designed to represent entire languages or varieties (usually at a single \n",
      "point in time), specialized corpora are designed to represent language in more \n",
      "specific contexts (McEnery and Wilson 2001: 5). Because they strive to represent \n",
      "language on a broad scale, general corpora tend to be very large in size, typically \n",
      "comprising thousands of texts and millions or billions of words. An example of \n",
      "a general corpus is the 100-million-word British National Corpus (BNC; Aston \n",
      "and Burnard 1998 ), which was compiled to represent contemporary written \n",
      "and spoken British English during the 1980s and 1990s. Given the practical \n",

      "various genres or registers that make up the target language or variety.\n",
      "Specialized corpora, on the other hand, tend to be much smaller than general \n",
      "corpora and usually represent a single or more restricted range of genres \n",
      "and registers. An example of a specialized corpus purpose-built for health \n",
      "communication research is the approximately one-million-word Adolescent \n",
      "Health Email Corpus compiled and analysed by Harvey as part of his research \n",
      "into the language adolescents use when seeking health advice (Harvey 2012, \n",

      "analysed a purpose-built corpus of 228,113 patient comments (approximately 29 \n",
      "million words) about the UK National Health Service (NHS).\n",
      "Another key feature of a corpus is that it contains naturally occurring language. \n",
      "In other words, corpora contain real language produced by real people in real-\n",
      "world contexts. The use of attested language data is a core feature of corpus study \n",
      "(McEnery and Gabrielatos 2006 ), and one that places corpus linguistics at the \n",
      "antipodes of the rationalist linguistics characterized by the Chomskyan tradition. \n",
      "In stipulating that only those discursive practices which can be intuited by the \n",
      "researcher are analytically relevant, Chomsky’s ( 1957 ) disregard for attested \n",
      "data represents something of a non-starter for empirical health communication \n",
      "research. In contrast, an overriding emphasis on naturally occurring language \n",
      "rather than native speakers’ verbal intuitions grounds corpus linguistics in \n",
      "the social sciences ( Stubbs 1996 ) and the discipline of applied linguistics \n",
      "(introduced earlier), where linguists’ work has a fundamental engagement with \n",
      "real-world concerns. The naturally occurring data used in corpus research exists \n",
      "prior to and regardless of its investigation by a researcher, permitting repeat \n",
      "analysis and the discovery of linguistic patterns not readily available to intuition \n",
      "(Carter 2004 ). The deliberate engagement with language use in contexts that \n",
      "are unfamiliar to the analyst is of clear relevance to the present study, where \n",
      "descriptions of experiences of mental illnesses would otherwise be unavailable \n",

      "phenomena of interest (e.g. words, chains of words, grammatical types), perform \n",
      "statistical tests on those frequencies (i.e. to measure the significance or strength \n",

      "it more amenable to qualitative discourse analysis (Baker 2006). The quantitative \n",
      "analyses are carried out automatically, removing the need for laborious manual \n",
      "reading and reducing the risk of researchers falling into miscalculations when \n",
      "confronted with overwhelming amounts data (Baker 2010). At the same time, \n",
      "computer assistance can be beneficial for the analysis itself, as it can render visible \n",
      "patterns that run counter to human intuition ( McEnery et al. 2006 ) or which \n",
      "feature sparingly in one or two texts but become significant when considered as \n",

      "In view of their analytical benefits, the volume of research employing corpus \n",
      "methods has expanded rapidly in the last thirty or so years, such that it has \n",
      "become difficult to overstate the impact that corpus linguistics has had on the \n",
      "study of language. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to state, as Leech ( 2000 : 677) \n",
      "does, that corpus linguistics has ‘revolutionized’ the ways in which we approach \n",
      "and now even conceptualize language. As part of this disciplinary revolution, \n",
      "corpus methods have been employed in increasingly ‘applied’ sub-disciplines of \n",
      "linguistics and used in combination with concepts and approaches from a range \n",

      "in the domain of health communication is no exception here. Indeed, Crawford \n",
      "et al. (2014)  argue that it is unsurprising that we find corpus methods employed \n",
      "to analyse the language of medicine, an institution largely driven by quantitative, \n",
      "‘evidence-based’ research. While analytically rigorous, purely qualitative studies \n",
      "are limited by their focus on relatively small datasets or single cases that ‘can \n",
      "only suggest possibilities’ of wider trends in health communication ( Drew 2001 : \n",
      "267). In contrast, as Harvey (2012: 353) notes, corpora ‘afford the researcher a \n",
      "level of analytical consistency not available to health communication research \n",

      "primary care consultations by Skelton and colleagues ( Skelton and Hobbs 1999a , \n",

      "Many subsequent corpus studies have been quick to capitalize on the wealth \n",

      "attested across separate messages posted by different users, can fulfil particular \n",
      "interactional goals. Chapter 5 elucidates the discourses that are used to represent \n",
      "depression, as well as the related topics of antidepressant medication and self-\n",
      "injurious behaviour. The final analytical chapter, Chapter 6, focuses on messages \n",
      "about diabulimia posted to online support groups for people with diabetes. As \n",
      "well as examining the discourses surrounding diabulimia itself, the analysis \n",

      "‘users’ and ‘sufferers’ . We realize the last of these may appear an emotive choice. \n",

      "mental health problems with which this book is concerned: anorexia, depression \n",
      "and diabulimia. Each of these topics is substantial by itself, meaning that our \n",

      "arguments about the contested nature of mental illness, we aim to foreground \n",
      "contrasting understandings of anorexia, depression and diabulimia. As we \n",
      "illustrate in the following sections, these contrasts frequently arise from the \n",
      "different disciplinary perspectives of medical and social scientists. However, \n",
      "they also emerge from the diversity of experiences of sufferers themselves \n",
      "(which, too, can be mediated by the disciplinary perspectives of researchers who \n",

      "Corpus, Discourse and Mental Health\n",
      "studies vary considerably, most estimate that between 75 per cent and 90 per \n",
      "cent of people affected by anorexia are women ( Sweeting et al. 2015 ).\n",
      "The DSM 5  (APA 2013) stipulates that anorexia is characterized by weight \n",
      "below that which is minimally normal for an adult or expected for a child \n",
      "or adolescent. In addition to this physical criterion, according to DSM 5 , \n",
      "individuals with anorexia are also distinguished by ‘[i]ntense fear of gaining \n",
      "weight or becoming fat, or persistent behaviour that interferes with weight gain, \n",
      "even though at a significantly low weight’ and ‘[d]isturbance in the way in which \n",

      "that distinguish anorexia from similar diagnoses such as avoidant/restrictive \n",
      "food intake disorder (2013: 337). Anorexia nervosa is also recognized as having \n",
      "two non-exclusive sub-types: restricting type, in which weight is lost through \n",
      "dieting, fasting and/or excessive exercise; and binge eating/purging type, in \n",
      "which individuals repeatedly engage in binge eating or purging through self-\n",

      "Apprehension over weight gain leads people with anorexia to strictly control \n",

      "increasing as weight is lost. Prolonged malnourishment and low weight places \n",
      "stress upon the body and can lead to osteoporosis and increased vulnerability \n",
      "to infection. In acute cases, anorexic starvation can lead to death through \n",
      "physical exhaustion, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration and infection ( Herzog \n",
      "et al. 1997 ). People with anorexia nervosa also show an increased risk of suicide \n",
      "(Hoek 2006) and Steinhausen’s ( 2002 ) review of 119 longitudinal studies reports \n",

      "by Lasègue (1873)  and Gull ( 1868 , 1874 ) and were based on examination of a \n",
      "small number of female patients. Gull emphasized that anorexia nervosa was a \n",
      "nervous disease with psychological causes, concluding that the cause of anorexia \n",
      "lies in ‘hysterical’ tendencies (1874: 25). Despite the ostensible neutrality of \n",

      "anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny the problem’(2013: \n",
      "340). Self-infliction is also implied in psychiatric descriptions of anorexia, not \n",
      "least the previous DSM ’s first diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa as a ‘ refusal  \n",
      "to maintain body weight’ (1994: 307.1, emphasis added), which defines the patient \n",

      "Fleming and Szmukler’s ( 1992 ) study of over 350 clinical staff found that patients \n",

      "depression and diabulimia. Given their greater public and academic recognition, \n",
      "these debates are more well developed in relation to anorexia and depression and \n",
      "rather less-so in relation to diabulimia. Nevertheless, there are some consistencies \n",
      "across the existing research into each condition. Most obviously, qualitative \n",
      "studies of sufferers’ accounts of these conditions reveal experiences of profound \n",
      "distress and personal conflict that in turn drive sufferers both to try to make \n",
      "sense of their illness and to seek support from others. In providing narratives \n",
      "of their illnesses, sufferers consistently employ representations that legitimize \n",
      "their experiences as genuine suffering and seek to explain how their distress \n",
      "has come about. Even in the case of diabulimia, where sufferers’ experiences \n",
      "remain notably understudied, this legitimizing tendency is revealed by the label \n",
      "for the condition that sufferers have adopted, which gestures towards medical \n",
      "terminology. Indeed, perhaps inevitably, medical discourse has a significant \n",
      "place in lay accounts of all three of these conditions. In the case of anorexia and \n",
      "depression, participants in qualitative studies have been shown to challenge the \n",
      "perceived stigma of their illnesses by conceiving of them as a form of biological \n",
      "malfunction. However, these medicalizing explanations have a double edge for \n",
      "sufferers, serving to place their illness beyond the limits of both their moral \n",

      "music, current events ( Largier 2002 ) and, since the early 1990s in particular, \n",
      "health ( Collot and Belmore 1996 ). Like many other forms of computer-mediated \n",

      "great that it lays beyond estimation (Crystal 2001). The content of internet fora \n",
      "is generated by users in one of two ways: either by creating a thread (a series of \n",
      "chronologically ordered messages or posts relating to a specific topic that have \n",
      "been contributed by numerous users) or by posting a message to an existing \n",
      "thread that has been created either by another user or by a forum moderator \n",
      "(Antaki et al. 2005 ). Messages tend to be primarily linguistic in content, although \n",

      "The benefit of having access to the disclosure of experiences of similar others \n",

      "others ( Salem et al. 1997 ).\n",
      "Despite their benefits, health fora have also been the focus of numerous \n",

      "information they contain, particularly on peer-led platforms, whose typical \n",
      "users are unlikely to have received any formal medical training ( ten Have \n",
      "2002 ). Indeed, it is possible for health forum contributors who have little \n",

      "Moreover, even when contributors do have relevant knowledge or experience, \n",
      "another challenge of user-generated health information is that users can \n",

      "ascertain how much of the information contained in online fora is factually \n",
      "misleading, though it seems probable, given the vast numbers of members and \n",
      "contributions that they typically host, that most health-related fora will contain \n",

      "content in an effort to prevent the circulation of offensive or unscrupulous \n",

      "Another potentially negative characteristic of many health fora relates to the \n",
      "contribution of scaremongering and negative information which might frighten \n",
      "other users ( Sandaunet 2008a ). In a study carried out by Broom and Tovey (2008) , \n",

      "suicide and to pro-eating disorders, in which anorexia and bulimia are presented \n",

      "to medical orthodoxy, these online spaces are claimed to legitimize practices \n",
      "that involve harming the body and which dissuade individuals from pursuing \n",

      "Space limitations mean it is not feasible to provide a thorough discussion of \n",

      "with Baker and Fortune’s (2008) perspective that a more nuanced response to \n",

      "and hence why some sufferers may opt to participate in online networks either \n",
      "in addition to or instead of conventional psychiatric care.\n",
      "Perhaps the main reason that online fora constitute such popular avenues \n",
      "for (mental) health-related disclosure and social support is that they provide \n",
      "conditions for more open and less inhibited expression. Relevant here is the \n",
      "concept of the ‘online disinhibition effect’; a theory developed by Suler (2004)  \n",
      "to account for the less inhibited nature of individuals’ communication and \n",
      "behaviours online compared against offline, face-to-face contexts. Suler argues \n",
      "that when interacting in anonymous computer-mediated contexts, people \n",
      "tend to ‘loosen up, feel less restrained, and express their selves more openly’ \n",
      "(2004: 321). Accordingly, the disinhibiting effect of CMC is brought about by \n",
      "six characteristics of communication in this context: anonymity, invisibility, \n",
      "asynchronicity, solipsistic introjection (imagining others’ reactions), dissociative \n",
      "imagination (being able to imagine that other interactants are not real people) \n",
      "and the minimization of authority. Although Suler argues that these factors work \n",
      "simultaneously and co-operatively, he also acknowledges that the ‘lion’s share’ \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "63\n",
      "Corpora and Methods of Analysis\n",
      "of this effect is created by three of these factors (2004: 322): (i) anonymity, (ii) \n",
      "invisibility and (iii) asynchronicity. We will now consider each of these factors \n",
      "in turn.\n",
      "According to Suler (2004), dissociative anonymity is the main contributory \n",
      "factor underlying the disinhibited nature of online communication. In the \n",
      "context of CMC, anonymity involves either the complete concealment of one’s \n",
      "identity or the presentation of one’s identity to others in an altered way that \n",
      "either conceals intimate aspects of the self or completely betrays one’s offline \n",
      "identity altogether. The anonymous nature of some online communication \n",
      "allows users to dissociate themselves from both their online behaviours and the \n",
      "offline behaviours that they describe and disclose online. Thus, Harvey (2013a: \n",
      "22) offers the analogy of users’ donning a ‘protective cloak of anonymity’ when \n",
      "communicating online, which allows them to ‘express the way they truly feel \n",
      "and think’ . Researchers propose that the anonymity of online environments \n",
      "can facilitate feelings of equality, potentially making contributors feel more \n",
      "at-ease to express information of a personal and sensitive nature (Attard and \n",
      "Coulson 2012). The opportunity for anonymity is particularly attractive to \n",
      "individuals who wish to disclose potentially face-threatening and stigmatizing \n",
      "health-related concerns. For example, Grohol (1998)  notes how individuals \n",
      "experiencing mental health issues are able to talk more openly and freely about \n",
      "their experiences in anonymous online environments because they can do so \n",
      "without anticipating negative judgement and evaluation, as might be the case \n",
      "(or at least as might be perceived to be the case) in non-anonymous contexts.\n",
      "The concept of invisibility in CMC is not too dissimilar to that of anonymity. \n",
      "Despite the increasingly multimodal character of CMC, hastened further by the \n",
      "emergence and growing convenience of multimodal media (such as video call \n",
      "applications), significant swathes of online communication remain text-driven, \n",
      "with interlocutors typically unable to see one another ( Goddard and Geesin \n",
      "2011 ; Barton and Lee 2013). Typed exchanges are frequently only accompanied \n",
      "by user profile pictures, or images or videos incorporated into the body of \n",
      "the message itself, none of which need actually depict the users themselves. It \n",
      "has been argued by scholars researching CMC that the invisibility afforded by \n",
      "platforms such as internet fora lends bravery to interlocutors, allowing them to \n",
      "talk about potentially face-threatening issues in an open and candid way ( Joinson \n",
      "2001 ; Suler 2004; Goddard and Geesin 2011). Invisibility also grants forum users \n",
      "the means to contribute to, or simply to visit and read, discussions about topics \n",
      "that they would never openly discuss in visible communicative contexts (e.g. a \n",
      "face-to-face conversation with a medical practitioner) for fear of prejudice and \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "64\n",
      "Corpus, Discourse and Mental Health\n",
      "negative evaluation. Furthermore, the double-blindness of online peer-to-peer \n",
      "support fora means that even if a user is negatively evaluated by other users on \n",
      "the basis of a forum contribution, unless that negative evaluation is expressed in \n",
      "a typed message, the impression of accommodation and acceptance is created \n",
      "by default (Joinson 2003). Another effect of invisibility is that interlocutors can \n",
      "communicate unhindered by the fear that they will be negatively prejudged or \n",
      "stereotyped on the basis of their ethnicity, sex or any other aspect of their identity \n",
      "that might be evident in their physical appearance. As Harvey argues, ‘invisibility \n",
      "produces a reduced sense of public awareness and, with this, a propensity for \n",
      "increased self-disclosure […] users of email do not have to concern their selves \n",
      "with how they look or sound when they send a message’ ( 2008 : 38).\n",
      "Finally, communication can be considered asynchronous if it does not \n",
      "require the simultaneous participation of all interlocutors. Asynchronicity \n",
      "contributes to the online disinhibition effect in as much as it does not require \n",
      "interlocutors to deal with others’ reactions and responses immediately. Suler \n",
      "(2004) contends that the ‘light’ temporal demands placed on interlocutors in \n",
      "asynchronous, compared to synchronous, communicative contexts means that \n",
      "greater amounts of time and thought may be committed to the creation of their \n",
      "contributions (i.e. forum messages), the result being that the interlocutor’s ‘train \n",
      "of thought may progress more surely and rapidly towards deeper expressions \n",
      "of disinhibition that sidestep social norms’ (Harvey 2008: 39; see also Wright \n",
      "and Bell 2003 ; Malik and Coulson 2008 ). Suler (2004) also proposes that the \n",
      "relaxation of these social norms in asynchronous communicative contexts can be \n",
      "particularly appealing to people who wish to disclose potentially embarrassing \n",
      "or face-threatening concerns (particularly in relation to their (mental) health), \n",
      "since they are comforted by having the option to depart from or leave behind \n",
      "the communicative situation at any point of discomfort or embarrassment \n",
      "(Suler 2004: 323).\n",
      "In light of the foregoing discussion, the communicative context of internet \n",
      "fora provides a platform on which people with mental health concerns can \n",
      "make sensitive self-disclosures and share their personal difficulties with a level \n",
      "of candour that would be unlikely in more inhibiting offline settings, such as \n",
      "face-to-face interactions ( Barak 2007 ). Moreover, these factors might facilitate \n",
      "less inhibited personal disclosure in the internet fora examined in this book, \n",

      "Indeed, corpus-enabled analysis of collocational patterns can provide a \n",
      "valuable perspective on the discursive structures that surround a word or \n",
      "phrase of interest. For example, Stubbs argues that the consistent co-articulation \n",

      "and connotations they have, and therefore the assumptions which they \n",
      "embody’ (1996: 172). In short, the meaning of a node’s collocates influences \n",

      "theory more generally (Sinclair 2004; Stubbs 2011 ). Concordant with Baker \n",
      "(2006; Baker et al. 2008), we argue that recurrent collocations constitute textual \n",

      "present only inexplicit means of identifying discourses. Echoing Foucault’s \n",

      "frequently co-occurring words, collocation analysis objectively highlights just \n",
      "such systematic linguistic representations – that is, discourses – in texts (Baker \n",

      "individuals’ conceptions of and relationships with their pre-existing diabetes \n",
      "intersect with their representations of diabulimia. For example, for the majority \n",

      "Common implementation remarks across all organizational intervention recommendations: \n",
      " ▶ An assessment of the work-related or psychosocial risk factors affecting workers’ (mental and \n",
      "physical) health should be undertaken in planning organizational interventions and should be \n",
      "integrated in continual and regular overall occupational health risk assessment and monitoring \n",
      "protocols at work – including whenever there are changes in the work or in the organization of \n",
      "work which may have a negative impact on health. \n",
      " ▶ Fidelity to implementation processes for organizational intervention – i.e. the extent to which \n",
      "an intervention was delivered as conceived and planned – is undervalued and understated, yet \n",
      "adherence to fidelity would likely benefit (health) outcomes.\n",
      "Subgroup remarks:\n",
      " ▶ Culturally and contextually sensitive planning and delivery of interventions is required. Some \n",
      "sociodemographic groups may be adversely and differentially affected by psychosocial risk \n",
      "factors more than others are; assessment and planning which takes account of the diversity of \n",
      "a workforce would identify such differences. Changes applied universally to psychosocial risk \n",
      "factors may benefit work settings with workers from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds. \n",
      "However, persons responsible for implementing organizational interventions should monitor \n",
      "the impact of the changes on workers to identify whether there are disproportionate impacts \n",
      "on some workers (such as, whether some workers who have flexible working arrangements \n",
      "experience negative job consequences such as lack of networking opportunities). \n",
      "Monitoring and evaluation remarks:\n",
      " ▶ Include work-related outcomes and mental health outcomes as part of continual monitoring \n",

      "Additional remarks:\n",
      " ▶ No direct evidence was obtained on preventing suicidal behaviours. Some occupations or work \n",

      "70\n",
      "Guidelines on mental health at workAs it is unclear whether the potential benefits of screening programmes outweigh potential harms, the GDG did not make a recommendation for or against screening programmes during employment.Key remarks:\n",
      "▶This statement does not apply to screening which may be required by necessity of regulation in some occupations, or screening when workers have been exposed to potential hazards to (mental) health.Screening programmes\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "19 Evidence for pre-employment screening was not considered as it falls outside the scope of the guidelines.\n",
      "             71\n",
      "Screening programmesEvidence and rationale\n",
      "Key question 13 investigated whether the use of screening programmes – i.e. programmes that are designed to identify workers with mental health problems and which are then followed by providing them with, or directing them towards, the necessary support during employment\n",
      "19 – were beneficial (Annex 3). A systematic review of primary studies was conducted. Thirteen studies were identified, with seven eligible for GRADE, for screening programmes versus screening followed by care as usual, wait list control or no intervention (web Annex).  Low-certainty data indicated no impact of screening programmes on reducing mental health symptoms or improving positive mental health. Very low-certainty data found small not significant improvements in work functioning, positive effects on productivity at 5 months which were not sustained at 12-month follow-up, and no effects on job satisfaction. There was a negligible improvement in absence which was not significant, although there was evidence for a small positive effect, albeit of very low certainty, at longer-term 5-year follow-up. One trial indicated greater likelihood of absence and lower likelihood of improvement in productivity for workers in receipt of screening programmes. Small improvements from low-certainty data suggested that screening programmes were beneficial with regard to immediate help-seeking behaviours but this was not sustained at follow-up assessments. Adherence to the supports following positive screening was low in one trial. No other direct harms were reported.The GDG concluded that there is a lack of clear evidence that the desirable effects of screening programmes during employment outweigh the undesirable effects (negligible or mixed change in key outcomes such as mental health symptoms and absence). Additional concerns were raised – including confidentiality and the risk of the likelihoods of false positives and false negatives when screening for mental health symptoms – such that one-time-screening results, if inaccurate and if misinterpreted, could lead to harms. Reporting bias is also a concern in screening programmes where workers are likely to under-report their symptoms for fear of confidentiality breaches \n",
      "(139) . On balance, the GDG concluded that it was not possible to provide a recommendation for or against screening programmes; therefore no recommendation was made.   The GDG highlighted that the “no recommendation” decision pertains to screening programmes conducted during employment, rather than pre-employment screening. The GDG noted that if screening takes place at work (e.g. by necessity of regulations), then the screening programmes should at least include:  \n",
      "▶  ensured follow-up to access evidence-based \n",
      "treatment or care for people who screen positive (see Recommendations 3 and 10 for relevant interventions for people with emotional distress); \n",
      "▶  involvement of qualified, professionally impartial \n",
      "health providers to deliver and interpret screening results and to manage referral to follow-up care; \n",
      "▶ensured privacy and confidentiality; \n",
      "▶  adherence to human rights principles and ethical \n",
      "considerations in order to prevent discriminatory treatment of persons screening positive. \n",
      "The Technical and ethical guidelines on workers surveillance \n",
      "(140)  and ILO Occupational Health Services Recommendation No. 171  \n",
      "(141) provide additional non-binding considerations for the surveillance of workers health and indicate that, preferably, workers’ health surveillance should be linked to the surveillance of occupational hazards present in the workplace.  \n",

      "Improvement of mental health and work-related outcomes is \n",
      "valued  by all stakeholders. While two included studies indicated that user satisfaction was positive, additional data indicate that workers are concerned about stigma and discrimination if they screen positive, as well as the confidentiality of their data to employers. Indeed, the lowest preference was given to screening programmes (web Annex: Values and preferences survey). This is also reflected in wider literature where such concerns generate under-reporting of mental ill-health by workers, even if their symptoms would indicate a need for further support (139)\n",
      ". \n",
      "Resource requirements  for screening alone may be small and limited to the mode of delivery (digital, paper) and to the automation or not of the interpretation of results. Whereas follow-up when screening positively will vary substantially in resources pending options available (from self-help to physician appointment). A \n",
      "cost-effectiveness  analysis in one included study from the Netherlands identified net benefits of € 651 per staff member, or for every euro invested a return of between € 5 and € 11 for employers.  \n",
      "For health equity, equality and discrimination, all identified studies were conducted in medium-to-large workplaces in high-income countries. No sociodemographic subgroup analyses were identified. There remains a perception of a considerable risk of discrimination against those screening positive for mental health symptoms, including fears of impact on employment status, career progression or other work task opportunities. It was noted that screening without effective follow-up can be harmful (142) . This may render the feasibility of large-scale screening programmes unethical in many contexts since access to quality mental health services remains limited. While screening and identification of individuals in need of support/care with the goal of reducing the burden of mental ill-health is in accordance with universal human rights principles, the screening of individuals at work elicits concerns about privacy, confidentiality and informed consent. In this situation, screening may appear to be involuntary and have a risk of discrimination with few observable benefits on key outcomes. The sociocultural acceptability of screening programmes for mental health at work remains unclear. \n",

      "The guidelines are available on the WHO website in English, with the executive summary available in all six United Nations languages. National ministries responsible for mental health and occupational health will be notified of the guidelines through WHO’s regional and country offices. Ministries for labour and employment, and representative bodies for workers and employers, will be notified of the guidelines through the ILO. The guidelines will be shared with a broad network of international partners, including representative organizations for persons responsible for or committed to the health, safety and well-being of workers, as well as WHO collaborating centres, universities, nongovernmental organizations and UN agencies. \n",
      "Implementation\n",
      "To facilitate implementation of the recommendations, a policy brief will accompany the guidelines, developed jointly by WHO and ILO. The policy brief will be made available in the six United Nations languages to facilitate wide dissemination and will present policy and implementation options which will be derived from the guidelines. WHO regional and country offices will encourage implementation at country level. The implementation may also be supported locally through the adoption and implementation of the WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013–2030) and the WHO global strategy for health, environment and climate change, both of which have been adopted by the World Health Assembly. Additionally, WHO will disseminate the guidelines and the joint policy brief through a broad network of international partners, including national ministries of health, WHO collaborating centres, key stakeholder groups (which represent the target audience of these guidelines), universities, nongovernmental organizations and United Nations agencies. The ILO will promote the dissemination of the policy brief among its tripartite constituents, including ministries of labour, in addition to employer and worker organizations. This will provide policy guidance on the roles and responsibilities of actors in the world of work in preventing, protecting and promoting, and supporting mental health at work.\n",

      "Future updating of the guidelines  \n",
      "The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of five years. The WHO Secretariat, in consultation with technical experts, will continue to follow research development in mental health promotion, prevention and interventions for workers – particularly for questions in which the certainty of evidence was found to be of low or very low certainty. If new evidence emerges or other important considerations arise which may have an impact on the current recommendations, WHO will coordinate an update of the guidelines, following the procedures outlined in the WHO handbook for guideline development, second edition  [26]. \n",

      "Prior to the development of the guidelines, an initial meeting – the Landscape Forum on Workplace Mental Health was held in Geneva, Switzerland in November 2019. One key objective was to discuss the extent of evidence for interventions addressing mental health at work. Following this meeting, the WHO Steering Group performed preliminary scoping of the available evidence in preparation for a draft scope for the guidelines. With the support of the Steering Group and guideline methodologist, the scope was reviewed by the GDG at its first meeting, held virtually in April 2020, which discussed and agreed on the final scope and PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions of the guidelines. Background questions were additionally devised in order to scope the best available evidence sources and to provide relevant contextual information for the prospective main body of the guidelines and for prospective evidence-to-decision considerations – in particular, 1) risk factors at work and their impact on mental health outcomes; and 2) the prevalence of mental health outcomes in general working populations and specific subpopulations (such as those identified as minority groups and humanitarian and health workers). Members of the WHO Steering Group, in consultation with the GDG and the methodologist, developed a list of outcomes that were most relevant to specific PICO questions. The GDG then rated each outcome on a scale from 1 to 9 and indicated whether it considered each outcome critical (rated 7–9), important (rated 4–6) or not important (rated 1–3) for decision-making. The final key questions are provided in the following table which includes the critical and important outcomes. Definitions of terms can be found in the glossary. The details of the PICO format for each key question are provided in the relevant section of the web Annex: Evidence profiles. Annex 3 \n",

      "In light of global changes in the modes of working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO Steering Group and GDG considered areas of importance to supplement the evidence reviews, namely: the values and preferences of key stakeholders and the implementation barriers and facilitators. Additionally, in light of the dearth of literature reported by the evidence teams in relation to the informal sector, a third piece of supplementary evidence was commissioned. Full reports of all three can be found in web Annex. A mixed-methods survey was commissioned to capture current values and preferences of key stakeholders – workers, employers, providers of mental health/occupational health services, including union representatives – in relation to the outcomes and interventions in the guidelines scope. Key data from the survey were included in the evidence-to-decision considerations.  A semi-structured interview with experts and providers of care for the informal sector was conducted in order to identify the needs and potential avenues of work and mental health service delivery for this population. A review of qualitative research was commissioned on the barriers to, and facilitators of, implementing interventions that support workplace mental health.

      "Developing the recommendations\n",
      "The GDG met virtually for six duplicate sessions in June 2021. Graham Thornicroft and Jose Luis Ayuso-Mateos were chairs of the meetings, which were held in duplicate sessions to accommodate the differences in time zones of GDG members. Corrado Barbui, the methodologist, was selected as vice-chair due to anticipated absences of the two chairs. Evidence reviews, supplementary evidence and GRADE tables were shared in advance with GDG members and were presented throughout the meetings. Formulation of the recommendations and their strength ratings were facilitated by the chairs and supported by the methodologist.The GDG benefited from a structured evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework which was developed by the evidence teams, with support from the WHO Steering Group and the methodologist, to guide the development of recommendations. The information which contributed to the EtD framework was informed by the systematic reviews, supplementary evidence, and the expertise of the GDG. The EtD factors were: the priority of the problem, certainty of the evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable effects, values, resources required, certainty in the resources required, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, health, equity, equality and non-discrimination, human rights and sociocultural acceptability. The latter two factors were adapted from the WHO INTEGRATE EtD (148), replacing the items of equity and acceptability in the GRADE DECIDE EtD (149).\n",

      "ably outweighed the undesirable effects. WHO’s guideline recommendations are developed through a process that aims to achieve consensus among the GDG members. Consensus was defined as a two-thirds majority vote. The GDG thus discussed and agreed on the recommendations, including the wording and direction (for or against the intervention) by consensus. The strength of each recommendation (strong or conditional) was agreed on by voting. Because meetings were held each day in duplicate, the progress of the first group of GDG members on a given discussion was then presented to the second group for further discussion and refinement. If the second group had major substantive disagreements with the recommendation, its revision was then presented to the first group in a final meeting. Had there been major disagreement by the end of the final scheduled meeting, there was an agreement to reconvene the GDG if needed. This was not the case. \n",

      "Following the formulation of the recommendations by the GDG, the Responsible Technical Officer drafted the guidelines for review by the GDG and ERG. The role of the peer review was not to change the recommendations agreed by the GDG; however, if the peer reviewers had identified major concerns, these would have been brought back to the GDG for consideration. This situation did not occur. The WHO Steering Group reviewed all peer review comments and, following discussion, revised the guidelines for clarity while making sure that the recommendations remained consistent with the original meaning as formulated by the GDG.WHO has an internal approval and quality assurance process to ensure that all WHO publications, including guidelines, meet the highest international standards for quality, reporting and presentation. These guidelines were reviewed and approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee (GRC). Finally, the guidelines were prepared for publication and dissemination.\n",

      "Foreword\n",
      "Adolescence is one of the most rapid and formative phases of human development. During this time \n",
      "adolescents develop knowledge and social-emotional skills and acquire attributes and abilities that are \n",
      "important for assuming adult roles and active contribution to society. Up to 50% of all mental health \n",
      "conditions start before the age of 14 years and up to one in five adolescents experience a mental \n",
      "disorder each year. Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among older adolescents. In \n",
      "turn, poor adolescent mental health is associated with a range of high-risk behaviours, including self-\n",
      "harm, tobacco, alcohol and substance use, risky sexual behaviours and exposure to violence, the effects \n",
      "of which persist throughout the life-course and have serious implications. \n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the well-being of young people and has put them at an \n",
      "increased risk of suicide, substance use and other mental health problems. Young people themselves \n",
      "report that their greatest concern is the toll that the pandemic is taking on their mental health. \n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) is committed to support Member States in promoting mental \n",
      "health and well-being towards achievement of target 3.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals \n",
      "(SDGs). This guidance, aimed at informing adolescent mental health and preventing mental health \n",
      "conditions, self-harm, substance use and other high-risk behaviours, is the first product of the Helping \n",
      "Adolescents Thrive (HAT) package that will be complemented by a series of implementation tools \n",
      "such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)/WHO HAT toolkit on programmatic guidance. \n",
      "The HAT package will support the operationalization of the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s \n",
      "and Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030), which recognizes adolescents as being central to achieving the \n",
      "SDGs, and facilitate country action in line with the recommendations of the Global accelerated action \n",
      "for the health of adolescents (AA-HA!): guidance to support country implementation , developed by WHO \n",
      "in partnership with other United Nations organizations. It will also contribute to the implementation of \n",
      "WHO’s comprehensive  Mental health action plan 2013–2020  (which has been extended to 2030), which \n",
      "identifies child and adolescent mental health as a priority area. \n",
      "This guidance is a milestone for translating opportunities for mental health promotion and disease \n",
      "prevention into action. It provides evidence-based recommendations on promotive and preventive \n",
      "psychosocial interventions for adolescents aged 10–19 years, which can be implemented in schools, \n",
      "health care settings, communities or through digital platforms. Particular attention is given to \n",
      "adolescents who are at increased risk for mental disorders or self-harm, and adolescents who present \n",
      "early signs and/or symptoms of emotional and/or behavioural problems. The HAT guidelines will thus \n",
      "support improved adolescent well-being and functioning, and help to reduce suffering due to mental \n",
      "health conditions and self-harm in adolescents. \n",
      "We encourage governments, education, health and other service planners, along with young people and \n",

      "Background \n",
      "The need to focus on the mental health of adolescents is gaining increasing recognition as the global \n",
      "community looks to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 3: “Ensure \n",
      "healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” and SDG 10: “Reduce inequalities within and \n",
      "among countries” (1). With adolescents comprising 16% of the global population, it is vital to address \n",
      "the main threats to their health in order to achieve the SDG targets (2). \n",
      "Mental health conditions account for a considerable proportion of the global disease burden during \n",
      "adolescence and are the leading cause of disability in young people. Up to half of all mental health \n",
      "conditions start before the age of 14 years. Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death among \n",
      "older adolescents (3). Poor mental health in adolescence portends a range of high-risk behaviours, \n",
      "including self-harm, tobacco, alcohol and other substance use, risky sexual behaviours  \n",
      "and exposure to violence, the effects of which persist and have serious implications throughout the \n",
      "life-course (4, 5) . \n",
      "There are multiple opportunities for health promotion and disease prevention in adolescence, which \n",
      "could benefit young lives in the short and long term. This stage is deemed as one of the optimal \n",
      "timeframes for intervention, given the neuroplasticity evident in adolescence and the opportunity \n",
      "to step in at a time when the majority of mental health conditions and risky behaviours have their \n",
      "onset  (3).\n",
      "Aim, scope and target audience\n",

      "evidence-informed programming to achieve that goal. The HAT guidelines have been prioritized by \n",
      "WHO as one of its global public goods for health.\n",
      "The guidelines are based on evidence from studies of interventions delivered to 10–19 year-olds, with \n",
      "particular attention to: (i) universal interventions delivered to unselected adolescents; (ii) targeted \n",
      "interventions delivered to adolescents who are known to be at increased risk of mental disorders \n",
      "or self-harm, because of exposure to specific adversities (violence, poverty and humanitarian \n",
      "emergencies), chronic illness (HIV/AIDS) and/or particular life circumstances (adolescent pregnancy \n",

      "and/or symptoms of emotional and/or behavioural problems but do not have a formal diagnosis of an \n",
      "emotional and/or behavioural disorder. In reviewing the evidence, the primary outcomes of interest \n",
      "were improved well-being and functioning, reduced symptoms and incidences of mental disorders, \n",
      "and reduction in self-harm among adolescents. Other outcomes of interest included reduced risky \n",

      "in pairs to independently review all remaining abstracts, using a short checklist of inclusion criteria. \n",
      "All reviewers convened to discuss any discrepancies in their views. Subsequently, two reviewers \n",
      "independently assessed full-text versions of all studies considered to be potentially relevant. Whenever \n",
      "there were doubts, a third researcher on the team made a ruling on the full text article. \n",
      "At this stage, the reviewers decided to exclude systematic reviews that did not contain randomized \n",
      "controlled trials. The reviewers also elected to include only reviews from 2015 onwards. This was in \n",
      "line with the advice of the GDG’s methodologist, who recommended the use of systematic reviews \n",
      "published within the previous five years.\n",
      "Reviews that met the requirements were subsequently assessed against a quality rating using the \n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete \n",
      "physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or \n",
      "infirmity“. Indeed, “there is no health without mental health”. \n",
      "Approximately 1 in 5 children display signs of poor mental health (UK Department \n",
      "of Health, 1995) and, at any given time, meet the criteria for a mental illness \n",
      "(Merikangas et al., 2010). About half of all mental illnesses begin in childhood and \n",
      "adolescence (Kirby & Keon, 2004).\n",
      "Schools afford a great opportunity not only to identify and support children who \n",
      "are experiencing emotional difficulties but more importantly to promote overall \n",
      "emotional well-being and social and moral development. Schools are imperative \n",
      "in mental health promotion and prevention. As the majority of countries in the \n",
      "WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region have a large population under the age of 18 \n",
      "years, investing in the mental health of children has long-term implications for the \n",
      "development of these countries and their ability to have a productive and skilled \n",
      "workforce. In addition, several countries in the Region have experienced recent wars \n",
      "or political unrest, increasing the vulnerability of these children and their families to \n",
      "mental disorders. \n",
      "School experiences are vitally important in both children’s intellectual development \n",
      "and their psychological well-being, and evidence increasingly illuminates the close \n",
      "connection between emotional health and academic achievement; hence, schools \n",
      "enhance school achievement by attending to issues such as self-esteem and social \n",
      "well-being (Hattie, 2008; Rutter, 1991). In addition to school success, children and \n",
      "adolescents who experience positive emotional and social well-being report greater \n",
      "satisfaction with their family and their relationship with friends (Gutman & Feinstein, \n",
      "2008). Conversely, children with emotional problems are more prone to academic \n",
      "failure and quitting school, making them vulnerable, targets for child labour, \n",
      "substance abuse, criminal involvement and violence, as well as unemployment. Thus, \n",
      "schools have a critical role to play regarding student mental health. \n",
      "Teachers have a significant responsibility for educating their students, and teaching \n",
      "can be both rewarding and challenging at the same time. Learning about school \n",
      "mental health will help teachers and not just be one more thing to do. Teachers \n",
      "often report that they need support in fostering wellness in their classroom and in \n",
      "identifying and supporting students with mental health challenges. When teachers \n",
      "feel better equipped to support student mental health, it is easier for them to manage \n",
      "difficult classroom behaviour and also to promote students’ academic success (see \n",
      "Appendix 1  for more information on teacher wellness). \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "2\n",
      "Effective social and affective education is directly beneficial to academic attainment \n",
      "and improves teacher effectiveness and satisfaction, such that promoting mental \n",
      "health in the class room is consistent with and supports the academic mission of \n",
      "schools (Weare, 2000). Even in developed countries such as Canada, a need was \n",
      "found for more teacher training about mental health and for a more proactive \n",
      "approach towards mental health in schools (Roger et al., 2014).\n",
      "Why should schools be invested in the mental health of their \n",
      "students?\n",
      "•\tInvesting in mental health results in improving academic achievement rates and \n",
      "decreasing grade retention and dropping out. For instance:\n",
      "\t○ children’s well-being is linked to their academic achievement (Gutman & \n",
      "Feinstein, 2008);\n",
      "\t○ student effort (i.e. the level of school attachment, engagement and \n",
      "commitment) is highly correlated with more positive academic outcomes \n",
      "(Stewart, 2007);\n",
      "\t○ school programmes that focus on social, emotional and academic learning \n",
      "from kindergarten through high school have been found to improve school \n",
      "attitudes, behaviour and academic performance (Zins et al., 2004). \n",
      "•\tSocial development, including meaningful peer relationships that promote \n",
      "psychological well-being and life skills, can improve academic achievement and \n",
      "motivation, while negative peer pressure or social disapproval towards school \n",
      "work might lead some students to drop out of school (Stewart, 2008; Nichols & \n",
      "White 2001). \n",
      "•\tStudents spend a significant amount of time at school (Rutter has estimated \n",
      "approximately 15 000 hours from kindergarten to completion) and are therefore \n",
      "accessible for mental health promotion, prevention and intervention. \n",
      "•\tStrengthening student protective factors and resilience within schools reduces \n",
      "negative risks and outcomes for vulnerable children.\n",
      "•\tPromoting school mental health helps decrease violence and juvenile crime. \n",
      "•\tSchools play a significant role in the early recognition and identification of \n",
      "children with mental illness and also in altering the school experience of these \n",
      "students to yield better outcomes. \n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "3\n",
      "•\tSchool is a more familiar and less stigmatizing or threatening environment for \n",
      "students in need of help compared to hospitals and medical offices.\n",
      "•\tWorking with children who have mental health problems can be very challenging \n",
      "and stressful to teachers (Hanko, 1993). Enhancing student emotional health can \n",
      "improve satisfaction and retention among teachers. \n",
      "•\tSchools influence the adoption of healthy behaviours (healthy diets, physical \n",
      "activity, etc., instead of substance abuse, delinquency, etc.) which improve \n",
      "quality of life across the lifespan. \n",
      "•\tChildren often establish deep and lasting relationships with teachers, school \n",
      "staff and peers at school: these relationships are also protective and supportive.\n",
      "•\tChildren learn to express themselves and actively participate in social activities \n",
      "at school and community projects: these experiences enhance their social \n",
      "connectedness and sense of belonging as well as their self-confidence and \n",
      "motivation for productive participation in society in the future.\n",
      "Target audience of this manual\n",

      "Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders are highly prevalent, accounting for a large burden of disease and disability globally. There remains a  wide gap between available health systems capacity and resources, what is urgently needed, and what is available to reduce the burden. Nearly 1 in 10 people have a mental health disorder, but only 1% of the global health workforce provides mental health care. MNS disorders interfere, in substantial ways, with the ability of children to learn and the ability of adults to function in families, at work, and in society at large.Recognizing the imperative to provide services for people with MNS disorders and their carers, and to bridge the gap between available resources and the large need for these services, the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse launched the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) in 2008. The key objectives of mhGAP  are to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders to increase the allocation of ﬁnancial and human resources for care  of MNS disorders and to achieve much higher coverage with key interventions in low-  and middle-income countries. Through these objectives, mhGAP provides evidence-based guidance and tools to advance toward achieving the targets of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020.  In 2010, the mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) for MNS disorders for non-specialized health settings was developed to assist in implementation of mhGAP. A simple technical tool based on the mhGAP guidelines, mhGAP-IG presents integrated management of priority MNS conditions using protocols for clinical decision-making. There is a widely shared but false notion that all mental health interventions are complex and can only be delivered by highly specialized staff. Research in recent years has demonstrated the feasibility of delivery of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions in non-specialized health-care settings. Since its release in 2010, mhGAP-IG has been widely used by a range of stakeholders including ministries of health, academic institutions, NGOs and other philanthropic foundations and researchers to scale-up mental health services. mhGAP-IG Version 1.0 is being used in more than 90 countries in all WHO regions and mhGAP materials were translated into more than 20 languages, including the six UN ofﬁcial languages.Five years after the initial launch of the guide, updates to the mhGAP guidelines  based on emerging literature was performed and revised mhGAP guidelines were published in 2015. We are now pleased to present mhGAP-IG Version 2.0 which not only reﬂects these updates but also extensive feedback from the ﬁeld to enhance the guide  in its clarity and usability. It is our hope that this guide will continue to be a key technical tool to deliver  care for people with MNS disorders around the world and lead us closer to achieving the goal of Universal Health Coverage.Shekhar SaxenaDirector, Department of Mental Health and Substance AbuseWorld Health OrganizationmhGAP-IG 2.0  Preface\n",

      "Mental Health Gap Action  Programme (mhGAP) – Background\n",
      "According to WHO Mental Health Atlas 2014, more than 45% of the world population lives in a country where there is less than 1 psychiatrist for every 100,000 people and there are even fewer neurologists. It is clear that relying solely on specialists to provide services for people affected by mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders would prevent millions of people from acces-  sing the services they need. Even when available, the interventions often are not evidence-based or of high quality. The Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) was thus developed with the objective of scaling up care for MNS disorders.The mhGAP approach consists of interventions for prevention and management of priority MNS conditions, identiﬁed on  the basis of evidence about the effectiveness and feasibility of scaling up these interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Priority conditions were identiﬁed based on the criteria that they represented a high burden (in terms of mortality, morbidity and disability), resulted in large economic costs or were associated with violations of human rights.  These priority conditions include depression, psychoses, self-harm/suicide, epilepsy, dementia, disorders due to sub - stance use and mental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents. The mhGAP-Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) is a resource to facilitate delivery of the mhGAP evidence-based guidelines in non-specialized health care settings. Uptake of mhGAP-IG Version 1.0 by WHO Member States and other stakeholders has been remarkable and clearly shows the need for such a tool. mhGAP-IG Version 1.0 has been used at the country level through the following varied methods: most commonly, as a key tool in the phased approach to scale-up mental health services on a regional, national, and sub-national level; as a capacity building tool for a wide range of health professionals and para-professionals; and as a reference guide for developing and updating undergraduate and post-graduate curricula for health professionals.\n",
      "Development of mhGAP Intervention Guide – Version 2.0\n",
      "The updated mhGAP guidelines and the feedback and evaluation from mhGAP-IG 1.0 users have shaped the revision and develop - ment of this updated version of mhGAP-IG. A complete update of the mhGAP guidelines following the WHO’s process of guideline development methodology, including the process of evidence review, synthesis and development of recommendations through the participation of an international panel of individual experts and institutions with appropriate background experi - ence: clinicians, researchers, programme managers, policy makers and service users, was performed and published in 2015. The detailed methods and updated recommendations can be found in the mhGAP Evidence Resource Centre. http://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/evidence/en/.Feedback has been received from experts in all WHO regions who used the mhGAP-IG package in the past three years to train non-  specialized health care professionals and to provide MNS services at several implementation sites. A preliminary draft of mhGAP-IG 2.0, based on expert and ﬁeld inputs, was then circulated among a wide group of reviewers across the world, allowing for a diversity of opinion in this intensive review process. This process incorpo - rated feedback from a range of end-users, including non-specialist health care providers and people with MNS disorders across all WHO regions. End-user feedback was collected through a questionnaire and locally facilitated focus group discussions were coordinated by WHO. Reviewer responses collected throughout this process have been incorporated into the mhGAP-IG 2.0.Furthermore, several users of mhGAP-IG have highlighted the limitations of only having a paper-based format, suggesting that interactive electronic or internet-based (e-) or mobile (m-) versions of mhGAP-IG might have beneﬁts in terms of increased ease of use, added functionality and cost savings. mhGAP-IG 2.0 has there-  fore, been designed and packaged with the intention to work across these multiple domains: paper, electronic, and mobile, with the e-mhGAP-IG currently under development and to be released soon. Incorporating this extensive feedback, the updated 2015 mhGAP guidelines and the new opportunities afforded by an e-version, the key updates of mhGAP-IG 2.0 include: \n",
      "  Content update in various sections based on new evidence, feedback and recommendations from mhGAP users. \n",
      "  Use of a vertical algorithm model, allowing for a streamlined and simpliﬁed clinical assessment. \n",
      "  Inclusion of new algorithm for follow-up in all modules. \n",
      "  Inclusion of two new modules: Essential care and practice (which is an update for the chapter on General Principles of Care in version 1.0) and Implementation module. \n",
      "  A revised module for Psychoses (integrating both psychosis and bipolar disorder), Child and Adolescent Mental and Behavioural Disorders (covering Developmental, Behavioral and Emotional Disorders), and Disorders due to Substance Use (including both disorders due to alcohol and disorders due to drug use).2\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "Use of mhGAP-IG Version 2.0\n",
      "The mhGAP-IG is a model guide and it is essential that it is adapted to the unique national or local situation. Users may select a subset of the priority conditions or interventions to adapt and implement, depending on the contextual differences in prevalence and availability of resources. Adaptation is necessary to ensure that the conditions that contribute most to disease burden in a speciﬁc country are covered, and that mhGAP-IG 2.0 is appropriate for  the local conditions that affect treatment of people with MNS disorders in the health care facility. The adaptation process should be used as an opportunity to develop a consensus on technical issues across disease conditions—this requires involvement of key national stakeholders. Adaptation will include language translation and ensuring that the interventions are acceptable in their sociocultural context and suitable for the local health system.The target user group of mhGAP-IG is non-specialized health-care providers working at ﬁrst- and second-level health-care facilities. These providers include primary care doctors, nurses and other members of the health-care workforce. Although mhGAP-IG 2.0 is to be implemented primarily by non-specialists, mental health care specialists may also ﬁnd it useful in their work. In addition, specialists have an essential and substantial role in training, support and supervision, and mhGAP-IG 2.0 indicates where access to specialists is required for consultation or referral to improve utilization of scarce resources. Specialists would also beneﬁt from training on public health aspects of  the programme and service organization. Implementation of mhGAP-IG ideally requires coordinated action by public health experts and managers, and dedicated specialists with a back-ground in public health. Therefore, training in the use of  mhGAP-IG is best done as part of a systems approach involving health planners, managers and policy makers so that the interventions proposed are supported by necessary infrastructure/resources e.g. availability of essential medicines. mhGAP-IG training also needs to be incorporated in an ongoing manner  with mechanisms in place to ensure adequate support, supervi - sion and refresher training for the healthcare providers.How to use the mhGAP-IG Version 2.0\n",
      "The mhGAP-IG is a model guide and it is essential that it is adapted to the unique national or local situation. Users may select a subset of the priority conditions or interventions to adapt and implement, depending on the context. \n",
      "  The mhGAP-IG 2.0 begins with “Essential Care and Practice”,  a set of good clinical practices and general guidelines for interactions of health care providers with people seeking mental health care. All users of the mhGAP-IG should familiarize themselves with these principles and should follow them as far as possible. \n",
      "  The mhGAP-IG includes a “Master Chart”, which provides information on common presentations of the priority conditions. This guides the clinician to the relevant modules. The most serious conditions should be managed ﬁrst. mhGAP-IG 2.0 has a new addition to the Master Chart –  Emergency Presentations of Priority MNS Conditions.  This section has been added to help identify emergency situations and direction to management guidelines. \n",
      "  The modules, organized by individual priority conditions, are a tool for clinical decision-making and management. Each module is in a different colour to allow easy differentiation. There is an introduction at the beginning of each module that explains which condition(s) the module covers and a quick overview describing key assessment and management steps. \n",
      "  Each of the modules consists of three sections:   Assessment  Management  Follow-up   The Assessment section is presented in a framework of ﬂowcharts with multiple clinical assessment points. Each module starts with common presentations of the suspected condition, from which there are a series of clinical assess - ment questions one should move down answering yes or no, which directs the user to move on for further instructions to reach a ﬁnal clinical assessment. It is important that users of the mhGAP-IG start at the top of the assessment and move through all the decision points to develop a comprehensive clinical assessment and management plan.   The Management section consists of intervention details which provide information on how to manage the speciﬁc conditions that have been assessed. This includes more technical psychosocial and pharmacological interventions when appropriate.   The Follow-up section provides detailed information on how to continue the clinical relationship and detailed instructions for follow-up management.    The mhGAP-IG 2.0 uses a series of symbols to highlight certain aspects within the modules. A list of the symbols and their explanation is given on the following page. Throughout the modules, important points are also highlighted as key clinical tips.  \n",
      "  Also included is a module on Implementation of mhGAP-IG, which provides summary steps on how to implement mhGAP-IG. \n",
      "  At the end of the guide, a glossary of terms used in  mhGAP-IG 2.0 is provided.\n",

      "I. Use Effective Communication Skills\n",
      "Using effective communication skills allows healthcare  providers to deliver good quality care to adults, adolescents,  and children with mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) conditions. Consider the following core communication skills  and tips:\n",
      "COMMUNICATION TIP #1\n",
      "Create an environment that  facilitates open communication \n",
      "   Meet the person in a private space, if possible. \n",
      "  Be welcoming and conduct introductions in a culturally appropriate manner. \n",
      "  Maintain eye contact and use body language and facial expressions that facilitate trust. \n",
      "  Explain that information discussed during the visit will  be kept conﬁdential and will not be shared without prior permission. \n",
      "  If carers are present, suggest to speak with the person  alone (except for young children) and obtain consent to share clinical information. \n",
      "  When interviewing a young woman, consider having  another female staff member or carer present.COMMUNICATION TIP #2\n",
      "Involve the person \n",
      "   Include the person (and with their consent, their carers  and family) in all aspects of assessment and management  as much as possible. This includes children, adolescents  and older adults.\n",
      "COMMUNICATION TIP #3\n",
      "Start by listening \n",
      "   Actively listen. Be empathic and sensitive.\n",
      " Allow the person to speak without interruption.\n",
      " If the history is unclear, be patient and ask for clariﬁcation.\n",
      "  For children, use language that they can understand. For example, ask about their interests (toys, friends, school, etc.).\n",
      "  For adolescents, convey that you understand their feelings and situation.\n",
      "COMMUNICATION TIP #4\n",
      "Be friendly, respectful and non-judgemental at all times \n",
      "   Always be respectful.\n",
      " Don’t judge people by their behaviours and appearance.\n",
      " Stay calm and patient.COMMUNICATION TIP #5\n",
      "Use good verbal communication skills \n",
      "   Use simple language. Be clear and concise.\n",
      "  Use open-ended questions, summarizing and clarifying statements.\n",
      "  Summarize and repeat key points.\n",
      "  Allow the person to ask questions about the information provided.\n",
      "COMMUNICATION TIP #6\n",
      "Respond with sensitivity when people disclose difﬁcult experiences (e.g. sexual assault, violence or self-harm) \n",
      "   Show extra sensitivity with difﬁcult topics. \n",
      "  Remind the person that what they tell you will remain conﬁdential. \n",

      "ESSENTIAL CARE AND PRACTICEII. Promote Respect and Dignity\n",
      "Persons with MNS conditions should be treated with respect  and dignity in a culturally appropriate manner. As a health care provider, make every effort to respect and promote the will  and preference of people with MNS conditions and support  and engage them and their carers in the most inclusive way.  Persons with MNS conditions are often more vulnerable to  human rights violations. Therefore, it is essential that in the health care setting, providers promote the rights of people with MNS conditions in line with international human rights standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD)*.*For more information on CRPD: https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html\n",

      "B. ESSENTIALS OF MENTAL HEALTH CLINICAL PRACTICE\n",
      "I. Assess Physical Health\n",
      "Persons with MNS disorders are at higher risk of premature mortality from preventable disease and therefore must always receive a physical health assessment as part of a comprehensive evaluation. Be sure to take a proper history, including both physical health and MNS history, followed by a physical health assessment to identify concurrent conditions and educate the person about preventive measures.  These actions must always be undertaken with the person’s informed consent.Assessment of Physical Health \n",
      "   Take a detailed history and ask about risk factors. Physical inactivity, inappropriate diet, tobacco,  harmful alcohol and/or substance use, risky behaviour  and chronic disease. \n",
      " Perform a physical examination. \n",
      " Consider a differential diagnosis.  Rule out physical conditions and underlying causes of MNS presentations by history, physical examination and basic laboratory tests as needed and available.   \n",
      "  Identify comorbidities.  Often, a person may have more than one MNS condition at the same time. It is important to assess and manage this when it occurs.Management of Physical Health \n",
      "    Treat existing comorbidities concurrently with the MNS disorder. Refer to/consult with specialists, if needed.\n",
      "    Provide education on modiﬁable risk factors to prevent disease and encourage a healthy lifestyle.\n",
      "   To support physical health of persons with MNS conditions,  health care providers should: –  Provide advice about the importance of physical activity and a healthy diet. –  Educate people about harmful alcohol use. –  Encourage cessation of tobacco and substance use. –  Provide education about other risky behaviour (e.g. unprotected sex). –  Conduct regular physical health checks and vaccinations. –  Prepare people for developmental life changes, such as puberty and menopause, and provide the necessary support. –  Discuss plans for pregnancy and contraception methods with women of childbearing age.\n",
      "CLINICAL TIP: Persons with severe mental disorders are 2 to 3 times more likely to die of preventable disease like infections and cardiovascular disorders. Focus on reducing risk through education and monitoring.8ECPESSENTIAL CARE & PRACTICE\n",

      "ESSENTIAL CARE AND PRACTICEII. Conduct a MNS Assessment\n",
      "Conducting an assessment for MNS conditions involves the following steps. First, the presenting complaint is explored, then a history is obtained including  asking about past MNS issues, general health problems, family MNS history, and psychosocial history. Observe the person (Mental Status Exam), establish  a differential diagnosis, and identify the MNS condition. As part of the assessment, conduct a physical examination and obtain basic laboratory tests as  needed. The assessment is conducted with informed consent of the person.\n",

      "51Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable disorder of the brain,  characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is one  of the most common neurological disorders and with proper  treatment, can be well controlled in the majority of people.  Epilepsy has many causes.  It may be genetic.  Epilepsy may occur  in people who have a past history of birth trauma, brain injury (including head trauma and strokes), or brain infections. In some people, no cause may be identified. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain and are of two types: convulsive and non-convulsive. Non-convulsive epilepsy has features such as change in mental status while con - vulsive epilepsy has features such as sudden abnormal movements, including stiffening and shaking of the body. The latter is associated with greater stigma and higher morbidity and mortality. This module covers only convulsive epilepsy. EPILEPSY\n",

      "69This module covers assessment and management of developmental disorders, behavioural disorders, and emotional disorders in children and adolescents.DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER is an umbrella term covering  disorders such as intellectual disability as well as autism spectrum disorders. These disorders usually have a childhood onset, impair - ment or delay in functions related to central nervous system matu - ration, and a steady course rather than the remissions and relapses that tend to characterize many other mental disorders. \n",
      " \n",
      "BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS is an umbrella term that includes specific disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorders. Behavioural symptoms of varying levels of severity are very common in the general population. Only children and adolescents with a moderate to severe degree of psy - chological, social, educational or occupational impairment in multiple settings should be diagnosed as having behavioural disorders. \n",
      " EMOTIONAL DISORDERS are among the leading mental health-related causes of the global burden of disease in young people.  Emotional disorders are characterized by increased levels of anxiety,  depression, fear, and somatic symptoms.Children and adolescents often present with symptoms of more than one condition and sometimes the symptoms overlap. The quality of home and social educational environments influence children’s and adolescents’ wellbeing and functioning. Exploring and addressing psychosocial stressors along with opportunities  to activate supports are critical elements of the assessment and management plan.CHILD & ADOLESCENT  MENTAL & BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS\n",

      "93Dementia is a chronic and progressive syndrome due to changes  in the brain. Although it can occur at any age, it is more common  in older people. Dementia is a significant cause of disability and  dependency among older people worldwide;  it has a physical,  psychological, social, and economic impact on carers, families,  and society at large.The conditions that cause dementia produce changes in a person’s mental ability, personality, and behaviour. People with dementia commonly experience problems with memory and the skills needed to carry out everyday activities. Dementia is not part of normal ageing. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause, however, dementia can be caused by a variety of diseases and injuries to the brain. People with dementia often present with forgetfulness or feeling depressed. Other common symptoms include deterioration in emotional control, social behaviour, or motivation. People with dementia may be totally unaware of these changes and may not seek help. Family members may notice memory problems, changes in personality or behaviour, confusion, wandering, or incontinence. However some people with dementia and their carers may deny or minimize the severity of memory loss and associated problems. Dementia results in decline in cognitive functioning and usually interferes with activities of daily living, such as washing, dressing, eating, personal hygiene, and toilet activities. Although there is no cure, with early recognition and supportive treatment, the lives of people with dementia and their caregivers can be significantly  improved, and the physical health, cognition, activity, and well-being of the person with dementia can be optimized.

This damage may be physical, e.g. liver  disease, or mental, e.g. episodes of depressive disorder. It is  often associated with social consequences, e.g. family or  work problems. DEPENDENCE is a cluster of physiological, behavioural, and  cognitive phenomena in which the use of a psychoactive substance takes on a much higher priority for a given individual than other  behaviours that once had greater value. It is characterized by a strong craving to use the substance and a loss of control over its use.

      " »   CAUTION is advised before embarking upon withdrawal from opioids, especially when there has been injection use. When a decision is made to initiate withdrawal, inform the person about what to expect, including symptoms and their duration. For example, withdrawal results in lower tolerance to opioids. This means that if the person resumes opioid use at their usual dose after withdrawal that they are at an increased risk of overdosing. Due to these risks, withdrawal is best undertaken when there is a plan for admission to a residential rehabilitation or other psychosocial support programme. Alternatively, the person may be considered for opioid substitution therapy with either methadone or buprenorphine; see the opioid agonist maintenance treatment section (see protocol 5), and select one of the following pharmacological options for management:\n",
      "»  Buprenorphine: Buprenorphine is given sublingually at a dose range of 4-16 mg per day for 3-14 days for withdrawal management. Before initiating buprenorphine treatment, it is important to wait until signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal become evident - at least 8 hours after the last dose of heroin and 24-48 hours after the last dose of methadone; otherwise, there is a risk that buprenorphine itself will precipitate a withdrawal syndrome. Special care should be taken for individuals taking other sedating medications.»  Methadone: Methadone is given orally at an initial dose of 15-20 mg, increasing, if necessary, to 30 mg per day. Then gradually decrease the dose, until tapered off completely, over 3-10 days. As with buprenorphine, special care should be taken for individuals taking other sedating medications.\n",
      "»  Clonidine or Lofexidine: If opioid substitution medications are not available, clonidine or lofexidine can be used to manage some opioid withdrawal symptoms, namely hyperarousal. They are given at dose ranges of 0.1-0.15 mg 3 times daily p.o. and are dosed according to body weight. Light-headedness and sedation may result. Monitor blood pressure closely. Other symptoms of withdrawal should also be treated, i.e. nausea with anti-emetics, pain with simple analgesics, and insomnia with light sedatives.\n",

      "2.2 Motivational Interviewing       (Brief Intervention) \n",
      " \n",
      "     Brief interventions using motivational interviewing is an approach to discussing substance use in a non-judgemental way. It encourages a person to reﬂect on their own substance use choices. It can be used as part of a very brief encounter for addressing risks or harmful substance use. It can also be used as part of a longer discussion that takes place over several sessions that address dependent patterns of substance use; this is referred to as Motivational Enhancement Therapy.  Throughout the discussion it is important to include all parts of the process: expressing empathy and building an atmosphere of trust, while also pointing out contradictions in their narrative, and challenging false beliefs. Avoid arguing with  the person. They should feel that the practitioner is there to support them and not to criticize them. If the person is unable to commit to ending their harmful pattern of substance use at this time, discuss why this is the case, rather than forcing the person to say what they think is expected.     Techniques for more in depth discussions: 1.  Provide personalised feedback to the person about the risks associated with their pattern of substance use, whether or not they have a pattern of HARMFUL USE or DEPENDENCE, and the speciﬁc harms they may be experiencing or causing to others. 2.  Encourage the person to take responsibility for their substance use choices, and the choice of whether or not to seek assistance for their substance use. Do this by asking them how concerned THEY are about their substance use. 3.  Ask the person the reasons for their substance use , including as a response to other issues such as mental health problems or speciﬁc stressors,  and the perceived beneﬁts they have from substance use, even if only in the short term.  4.  Ask about their perception of both the positive and negative consequences of their substance use and, if necessary, challenge any overstatement of the beneﬁts and understatement of the risks/harms. 5.  Ask about the person’s personal goals, and whether or not their substance use is helping them or preventing them from reaching these goals. 6.  Have a discussion with the person based on the state-ments about their substance use, its causes, consequences and their personal goals, allowing exploration of apparent inconsistencies between the consequences of substance use and the person’s stated goals.    7.  Discuss options for change based on the choice of realistic goals and try to ﬁnd a mutually agreed course of action. 8.  Support the person to enact these changes by commu-  nicating your conﬁdence in them to make positive changes in their life, by provide information on the next steps as needed (further review, detoxiﬁcation, psycho-social support),  and by providing the person with take-home materials if available. \n",
      "    Examples of questions to ask. Non-judgmentally elicit from the person their own thoughts about their substance use by asking the following questions: 1.  Reasons for their substance use. (Ask: “Have you ever thought about why you use [substance]?”) 2.  What they perceive as the beneﬁts from their use.  (Ask: “What does [substance] do for you? Does it cause you any problems?”) 3.  What they perceive as the actual and potential harms from the substance use. (Ask: “Has [substance] use caused you any harm? Can you see it causing harm in the future?”)   4.  What is most important to the person.  (Ask: “What is most important to you in your life?”)\n",

      "CLINICAL TIP:   HIV/TB/HEPATITIS and SUBSTANCE USE\n",
      "   People who inject drugs are at increased risk of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, particularly if they do not use sterile injection equipment or have unsafe sex in exchange for drugs; once infected, they also have a worse prognosis. HIV/AIDS also increases the risk of TB infection, and active TB is a main cause of death in people living with HIV/AIDS. People who use alcohol and drugs heavily are also at increased risk for TB. Therefore, a common presentation is of a person who has a combination of drug use, particularly i.v. heroin use, and infection with TB, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis at the same time.\n",
      "   Services that treat people who use drugs and alcohol should regularly test all people who inject drugs for  HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, and should have a high level  of suspicion for TB in any person with a cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss.  \n",
      "   Treatment of HIV/AIDS and TB requires taking daily medica-tions, where every single day is important. Directly obser-ving the treatment can improve treatment adherence. If the person is also opioid dependent, providing daily observed methadone or buprenorphine treatment at the same place and time will further facilitate treatment adherence.  \n",

      "   Organize a workshop with a group of different stakeholders to contextualize and adapt the mhGAP-IG, its training materials and M&E and other tools.  \n",
      "  Include experts representing relevant disciplines, (e.g. psychiatry, addiction, neurology, paediatrics, social work  and psychology), people representing different levels of general health care, (e.g. public health practitioners, primary health care providers, family medicine specialists, nurses, pharmacists, health information system practitioners), service users and policy makers. \n",
      "  Use the situation analyses conducted for the regions in which mhGAP-IG will be implemented. \n",
      "  Ensure that the adaptation process is in line with national documents, (e.g. the national health policy, legislation and plan, clinical protocols and guidelines used in general/primary health care and the national medicine list). 1.  mhGAP-IG training & supervision \n",
      "An important aspect of mhGAP-IG implementation is the training of healthcare providers working in non-specialist settings to deliver interventions as front line personnel, along with mechanisms to ensure their continued support and super-  vision.  Although the intervention guide is to be implemented primarily by non-specialists, it requires coordinated effort by specialists and public health experts to ensure its optimum delivery.The objective of mhGAP-IG training is to teach non-specialist healthcare providers the skills and knowledge needed to assess and manage people with priority MNS conditions. The duration of training depends on the local adaptations made, as well as on the knowledge and skills that non-specialist healthcare providers already have. Usually this training process takes several full days and can be conducted face-to-face or via e-learning, depending on feasibility.The training structure can follow a cascade plan with two levels: a master facilitator trains ‘trainers’ who then train the non-specialist front-line healthcare providers.4 5IMPLEMENTATION OF mhGAP-IG\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "IMPLEMENTATION OF mhGAP-IG 155mhGAP-IG train the trainers:\n",
      "The objective is to ensure that trainers are skilled and conﬁdent in their ability to train non-specialist healthcare providers and act as informed resources for these providers.mhGAP-IG trainers/supervisors should have the  following characteristics:  \n",
      "  Be specialists in MNS health care (psychiatrist, psychiatric  nurse, neurologist, etc.), physicians or nurses trained and experienced in managing MNS conditions using mhGAP-IG, and/or existing supervisors for the general health system.\n",
      "  Have clinical skills and experience in mental health and/or management of MNS conditions. \n",
      "  Have skills and experience with administrative aspects  of managing MNS conditions, including record keeping, follow-up and referral. \n",
      "  Be good facilitators and problem-solvers. \n",
      "  Available for support and supervision, including regular supervisory visits. The training agenda:  The trainers are expected to conduct future mhGAP-IG training courses and provide support and supervision to health care providers. Apart from training in the assessment and manage-  ment of people with MNS conditions, as described in the mhGAP-IG, they will learn about methods of training, planning of curricula, methods of supervision and quality assurance.mhGAP-IG support & supervison:\n",
      "Participants in the mhGAP-IG training course (mhGAP-IG trainees) are usually non-specialized health care staff working in primary or secondary health care clinics/hospitals. They require ongoing help to transfer what they have learned in training to their clinical practices. Supervision is seen as part of the continuum of education required to create competent mhGAP health care providers. Support and supervision not only aims  to assist mhGAP-IG trainees to deliver improved mental health care (clinical supervision) but also provides support in the work environment related to mhGAP-IG implementation (administra-tive and program supervision).Speciﬁc goals of support & supervision: \n",
      "  Assist in the transfer of skills and knowledge from the mhGAP-IG training into clinical practice. \n",
      "  Ensure adequate delivery of mental health interventions that in line with mhGAP-IG and address areas for further skills development. \n",
      "  Identify and assist with problems faced by mhGAP-IG trainees in managing complicated clinical situations. \n",
      "  Help motivate non-specialized health care workers to provide good quality care for people with MNS conditions. \n",
      "  Ensure necessary records and administrative procedures  for MNS conditions, such as referrals and follow-up, are established and/or integrated into existing systems at the local health care facilities.   Ensure that the supply of medicine, medical equipment and other support systems for mhGAP-IG implementation are operational. \n",
      "  Demonstrate and encourage respectful, non-judgmental attitudes and ethical treatment that promotes and protects the human rights of individuals with MNS conditions. \n",
      "  Provide support to healthcare providers experiencing stress.\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "156IMP\n",
      "1.  Monitoring & Evaluation\n",
      "Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) can provide information about whether a programme is making a difference and for whom; it can identify programme areas that are on target or aspects of a pro-  gramme that need to be adjusted. Information gained from M&E can demonstrate to programme implementers and funders that their investments are paying off. M&E provides vital information for learning from past experiences, improving service delivery, planning, resource allocation and demonstrating results as part  of accountability to key stakeholders. The phrase, “what gets measured gets done,” summarises the importance of monitoring  & evaluation in programme planning and implementation. M&E involves planning, coordinating, collecting, analysing  and using data from national, district and local levels, including health facilities and mhGAP-IG facilitators, trainees and super-visors; therefore, it will be helpful if the mhGAP-IG implemen-tation team appoints a M&E coordinator or sub-committee  to plan and carry this out.Some examples of indicators that can be used to monitor  mhGAP-IG implementation are: facility-level indicators, e.g. number of non-specialist health care providers trained on mhGAP-IG, number of support and supervisory visits to each health facility implementing mhGAP-IG; and system-level indicators, e.g. number of health facilities using mhGAP-IG to assess and manage persons with MNS conditions, number of health facilities with an uninterrupted supply of essential medicines for MNS conditions.Ensure that the indicators are part of the national health information system. Collecting data using indicators will assist in monitoring mhGAP-IG. They will also assist in reporting on national mental health every two years to the WHO Mental Health Atlas, to monitor progress on implementation of the Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020.Evaluate the mhGAP-IG implementation process, identify successes as well as needs for improvement and update the situation analysis.In addition to the six actions described above, there are three continuous activities that form an essential part of mhGAP-IG implementation. These are described in the sections below. \n",
      "A. PROVISION OF TREATMENT AND CARE:\n",
      "The mhGAP-IG recommends a number of pharmacological and psychological interventions be provided by non-specialised health care providers. It recommends, for example, problem solving therapy (PST) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) for adult depression. WHO has developed psychological interventions in simpliﬁed form. These are scalable interventions and their delivery requires  a less intense level of specialist human resource use. It means  that the intervention has been modiﬁed to use fewer resources compared with conventional psychological interventions and that people with and without previous training in mental health care can effectively deliver low-intensity versions of PST and IPT as long as they are trained and supervised. Examples of WHO scalable psychological interventions manuals which are part of  the mhGAP package include: the WHO Problem Management Therapy PM+ manual, the WHO Interpersonal Therapy manual (IPT), the WHO Thinking Healthy manual for maternal depression, and the WHO Parental Skills training manual.Essential medicines can be used to treat symptoms of MNS conditions, to shorten the course of many disorders, reduce disability and prevent relapse. Essential medicines are part of the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines. Access to essential medicines is a component of “the right to [the highest attainable standard of] health.”There are four main groups of  medications that target priority MNS conditions mentioned in this guide:  antipsychotics for psychotic disorders;\n",
      "  drugs used in mood disorders (depressive or bipolar); \n",
      "  anticonvulsants/antiepileptics;\n",
      "  medications used for management of substance withdrawal, intoxication or dependence .The experiences of many countries demonstrate that improvements in the supply and use of medicines are possible. Access of populations to essential medicines are determined by: (i) a rational selection of medicines; (ii) making prices affordable; (iii) ensuring sustainable ﬁnancing; and (iv) availability of reliable health and supply systems.\n",
      "B. ADVOCACY AND AWARENESS RAISING: \n",
      "Mental health advocacy uses information in deliberate and strategic ways to inﬂuence others to create change. It involves the promotion of the needs and rights of people with mental disorders, as well as that of the general population. Advocacy is different from education. Education informs and helps create understanding of an issue. Advocacy, on the other hand, aims to persuade. This is done through requests and calls for speciﬁc actions. One basic principle is that advocacy is only effective when the target audience is asked to do something. Mobilizing people means asking them to become part of the solution.  6IMPLEMENTATION OF mhGAP-IG\n",

      "IMPLEMENTATION OF mhGAP-IG 157Examples of advocacy actions \n",
      "Advocacy actions within the general population:\n",
      "  Include and mobilize people with MNS conditions and their carers in the advocacy actions. Ensure that the community has direct and positive social contact with people with  MNS conditions.\n",
      "  Use the media to increase awareness of mental health issues, e.g. through public announcements, magazine features and announcement at health centers, while at same time emphasizing the need for responsible reporting, particularly regarding suicide.  \n",

      "  Promote an understanding of the importance of community care, community participation and human rights of people affected with MNS conditions. \n",
      "  Provide adequate training and support to mental health and general health workers.C. NETWORKING AND INTERSECTORAL  COLLABORATION:\n",
      "mhGAP-IG implementation requires collaboration amongst various sectors and stakeholders, such as: \n",
      "  Specialist and non-specialist health services and care-providers: e.g. psychologists, community health workers, social workers,inpatient or outpatient service providers, outreach care workers. \n",
      "  Service users: e.g. groups or individuals living with the same condition, family members with the same condition or caring for someone with the same condition (after seeking consent from all those involved). \n",
      "  Family and friends: Identify the person’s prior social activities that, if reinitiated, would have the potential for providing direct or indirect psychological and social support (e.g. family gatherings, outings with friends, visiting neighbors, social activities at work sites, sports, community activities) and encourage the person to resume these activities.\n",
      "  Informal community supports: e.g. spiritual groups, saving groups, recreational groups, women groups, youth support groups, cultural groups, self-help groups, helplines.\n",
      "  Education and employment: e.g. schools, education, income generating or vocational training programmmes. Speciﬁcally, suicide prevention programmes in school settings that include mental health awareness training and skills training to reduce suicide attempts and suicide deaths among adolescent students.\n",
      "   Non-governmental organizations: e.g. legal aid, child protection services, gender based violence programmes or psychosocial support programmes. \n",
      "   Government services and beneﬁts: e.g. public justice systems, child welfare, pension, disability, transportation discounts.  To facilitate efﬁcient collaboration between these  groups, it is important to:  Ensure that members of the mhGAP-IG implementation  team have clear roles and functions.\n",
      "   Prepare a list of resources and beneﬁts to help non-specialized health care staff make meaningful links for those with mhGAP priority conditions, their carers and other family members by gathering information from the situational analysis and regularly updating the list based on new information.\n",

This concept has several assessment tools to determine an individual’s ability to perform the activity with or without assistance.AgitationMarked restlessness and excessive motor activity, accompanied by anxiety.AgranulocytosisA blood disorder in which there is an absence of granulocytes  (a type of white blood cell). It is an acute condition involving a severe and dangerous leukopenia, also known as drug-induced secondary agranulocytosis.AkathisiaA subjective sense of restlessness, often accompanied by observed excessive movements (e.g. ﬁdgety movements of the legs, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still).AkinesiaThe absence or lack of voluntary movement. A state of difﬁculty in initiating movements or changing from one motor pattern to another that is associated with Parkinson’s disease.Altered mental statusA changed level of awareness or mental state that falls short of unconsciousness which is often induced by substance intake or other mental or neurological conditions. Examples include confusion and disorientation. See delirium and confusional state. Alzheimer's diseaseA primary degenerative cerebral disease of unknown etiology in  the majority of cases with characteristic neuropathological and neurochemical features. The disorder is usually insidious in onset and develops slowly but steadily over a period of several years.Anticholinergic side-effectsAnticholinergic medicines block the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Anticholinergic effects include dryness of the mouth, urinary frequency or retention, palpitations and sinus tachycardia.Aplastic anaemiaA disease characterized by the inability of  blood stem cells to generate new mature cells. This disease is also characterised by low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      " Mental, neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders are highly prevalent, accounting for a substantial burden of disease and disability globally. In order to bridge the gap between available resources and the significant need for services, the World Health Organization launched the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The objective of mhGAP is to scale-up care and services using evidence-based interventions for prevention and management of priority MNS conditions. The mhGAP Intervention Guide version 1.0 for MNS disorders for non-specialist health settings was developed in 2010 as a simple technical tool to allow for integrated management of priority MNS conditions using protocols for clinical decision-making. With uptake in over 90 countries, mhGAP-IG 1.0 version has had widespread success. It is our pleasure to present mhGAP version 2.0, with updates incorporating new evidence-based guidance, enhanced usability, and new sections to expand its use by both health care providers as well as programme managers.It is our hope that this guide will continue to provide the road-map to deliver care and services for people with MNS disorders around the world and lead us closer to achieving the goal of universal health coverage.     \n",

      "Any death by suicide is a deeply sad occasion. It is extremely painful for close family members and friends left behind who cannot understand why it happened. Inevitably, their sadness is multiplied as they ask themselves what they could have done to prevent the untimely death.\n",
      "There are more than 700 000 deaths by suicide worldwide every year – each one a tragedy, with far-reaching impact on families, friends and communities. These untimely and unnecessary deaths are the reason why this guide is so important.\n",
      "We cannot – and must not – ignore suicide. Although some countries have placed suicide prevention high on their agendas, too many countries remain uncommitted. The targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the World Health Organization’s Mental Health Action Plan for reducing the global suicide mortality rate will not be achieved unless we transform our efforts to implement effective actions to prevent suicide.LIVE LIFE is WHO’s approach to suicide prevention. It details the practical aspects of implementing four evidence-based interventions for preventing suicide, plus six cross-cutting pillars which are fundamental for implementation. Throughout this guide, the LIVE LIFE interventions and pillars are accompanied by case studies from countries across the world. These case studies provide a wide range of inspiring activities in diverse contexts. We hope that decision-makers will consider the lessons learned by countries and communities that have been successful in suicide prevention.LIVE LIFE recognizes the role that both governments and communities play in implementing actions for suicide prevention. Currently, 38 countries are known to have a national suicide prevention strategy. While a funded national suicide prevention strategy that includes LIVE LIFE interventions and pillars remains the pinnacle of a government-led response to suicide, the absence of such a strategy should not prevent a country from starting LIVE LIFE implementation. By implementing LIVE LIFE, countries will be able to build a comprehensive national suicide prevention response.This guide serves as a catalyst for governments to take evidence-based actions. It enables countries to protect the lives of people who find themselves in severe distress and are at risk of suicide. But preventing suicide is not the responsibility of governments alone. Each of us has a role to play, watching out for our friends, families and colleagues and offering them our support when we think they might need it. It can make all the difference.\n",

      "Over 700 000 people lose their life to suicide every year. Reducing the global suicide mortality rate by one third by 2030 is both an indicator and a target (the only one for mental health) in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030. WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work 2019–2023 includes the same indicator with a reduction of 15% by 2023.The world is not on track to reach the 2030 suicide reduction targets. WHO advocates for countries to take action to prevent suicide, ideally through a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. Governments and communities can contribute to suicide prevention by implementing LIVE LIFE – WHO’s approach to starting suicide prevention so that countries can build on it further to develop a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. The guide is for all countries, with or without a national suicide prevention strategy at present.  \n",
      "PART A. LIVE LIFE CORE PILLARS\n",
      "The core pillars of LIVE LIFE are as follows:  • Situation analysis• Multisectoral collaboration• Awareness-raising and advocacy• Capacity-building• Financing• Surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.Part A examines each of these core pillars by asking the questions “What?”, “Why?”, “Where?”, “When?”, “Who?” and “How?”. There is a table for each pillar showing what elements should be included, examples from around the world are provided in boxes and each subsection concludes with “tips for implementation”. Situation analysis provides the background and current profile of suicide and suicide prevention. It is therefore important for informing the planning and implementation of suicide prevention activities. The analysis can be carried out nationally, regionally or locally and should be conducted at the start of suicide prevention efforts by a dedicated working group of specialists, stakeholders and persons with lived experience of suicide. The working group collects data (such as rates of suicide and self-harm, methods used, precipitating or protective factors, legislation, services and resources), conducts the situation analysis, produces a report and shares it with decision-makers, policy-makers and funders to influence resource mobilization and/or mandate for action. Major issues of concern are to ensure confidentiality, protect people’s privacy and avoid encouraging suicides.Multisectoral collaboration is necessary since the risk factors for suicide are linked with many areas. A whole-of-government or whole-of-society approach works across government sectors or departments and includes nongovernmental and community groups. Under the leadership of government, this approach facilitates knowledge-sharing, exchange of methodologies and lessons learned, and sharing of suicide-related data and research. It also fosters transparency and accountability. This collaboration must start early and both government and partners need to make sure they are prepared. A multisectoral approach relies on a vision for collaboration and an agreed method of engagement with routine evaluations. Problems may arise if non-health sectors consider suicide to be solely a health problem. Each stakeholder’s role must de clearly defined and actions agreed in case stakeholders find it difficult to fulfil their responsibilities.Awareness-raising and advocacy depend on an organized process of communication that targets a public audience. Awareness-raising draws people’s attention to facts such as suicide is a serious public health issue. Advocacy aims to bring about changes such as decriminalization or a national suicide prevention strategy. Awareness-raising and advocacy for suicide prevention can range from events in a single community to nationwide public communication campaigns and can be continuous, regular or annual happenings (such as World Suicide Prevention Day), with “champions” leading public campaigns. It is important to decide the message to be communicated, adapt it to the target audience, select the means of communication and test the acceptability and potential impact of the message beforehand. Initiatives should have a clear focus and a call to action, such as linking people with support services rather than addressing suicide in general.Capacity-building can be coordinated at the national level or conducted in the community. Capacity-building can be delivered by including suicide prevention in pre-service or continued training of health workers, but it can also be triggered when problems such as high rates of suicide or stigma arise. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "LIVE LIFE  |  xiIt may be directed to health workers, emergency service staff, teachers and youth workers, and others such as hairdressers or bartenders who often chat with their clients. For non-specialized health workers and community health workers, the self-harm/suicide module of WHO’s mhGAP Intervention Guide and associated training materials can be used. A training-of-trainers model is recommended as it increases the human resources available to deliver training. With such a wide range of trainees it is important that training is adapted to the sociocultural context and that it strengthens recipients’ knowledge about suicide and its prevention.Financing for suicide prevention is often meagre because of factors such as poor economic conditions, lack of prioritization of suicide as a serious issue, and lack of recognition that suicides are preventable. Requests for funds should include a focus on the development and implementation of policies, strategies and plans, and not only on development of services. The guide gives advice on how to approach fundraising for suicide prevention, noting that it should be a continuing process. The stages of defining the budget are described, as are researching and identifying potential funders, developing proposals and maintaining relations with funders irrespective of their decision. Concerned groups are encouraged to share stories that demonstrate the impact of well-funded suicide prevention interventions.Surveillance can provide data on suicide and self-harm to guide LIVE LIFE interventions. Data sources such as civil registration and vital statistics, health and police records, verbal autopsies and population-based surveys are highlighted, though much depends on how much suicide and self-harm surveillance has been done before. Preference should be given to obtaining high-quality data from several representative locations rather than poor-quality data from the entire country. Key findings, including rates and trends in suicides and self-harm, can help guide prevention activities. Consequently, it is important to publish reports regularly to inform action.Monitoring and evaluation should consider whether an intervention was effective, whether it was delivered as intended, and whether it was efficient in terms of value for money. Detecting changes in suicide rates is challenging but is necessary to assess whether LIVE LIFE is achieving its intended result of reducing suicide and self-harm. Monitoring and evaluation are likely to require a specialized team (including, for instance, epidemiologists, statisticians and data collectors) and it may be helpful to partner with academic institutions. Outcomes will need to be defined and indicators identified, with the principal goal being a reduction in the rates of suicide and self-harm. The guide emphasizes that without clear goals and indicators it will be difficult to show progress and hence more difficult to justify funding. \n",
      "PART B. LIVE LIFE: KEY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION\n",
      "The interventions described in the guide are: • Limit access to the means of suicide• Interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide• Foster socio-emotional life skills in adolescents• Early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours.As for the core pillars in Part A, the questions “What?”, “Why?”, “Where?”, “When?”, “Who?” and “How?” are asked for each of the interventions in Part B.Limiting access to the means of suicide  is a universal evidence-based intervention for suicide prevention. Depending on the country, this may mean banning highly hazardous pesticides, restricting firearms, installing barriers at “jump sites”, limiting access to ligature points or taking other measures to make it more difficult to access the means of suicide. Most people who engage in suicidal behaviour experience ambivalence about living or dying, and many suicides are a response to acute stressors. Making lethal means of suicide less easily available gives persons in distress time for acute crises to pass before taking fatal action. This section focuses on pesticides, which are estimated to account for one fifth of all suicides globally. They are a particular problem where there is a large proportion of rural residents working in agriculture.Restricting access to pesticides requires multisectoral collaboration between all relevant stakeholders, including ministries of health, agriculture, regulators and registrars, as well as community leaders. The same principle of a multisectoral national approach applies to other means of suicide (e.g. the transport sector and the need for barriers). At the personal level, family members may be asked to remove the means of suicide (e.g. pesticides, firearms, knives, medication) from a household where a person is at risk of suicide. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "xii  |  LIVE LIFEImportantly, evidence shows that restriction of one method of suicide does not inevitably lead to a rise in the use of others.Interacting with the media for responsible reporting of suicide is significant because media reporting of suicide can lead to a rise in suicide due to imitation – especially if the report is about a celebrity or describes the method of suicide. The aim at country level is to work with national media (and social media) bodies and at local level to work with local media outlets such as local newspapers or radio stations. The guide advises monitoring the reporting of suicide and proposes offering examples of high-profile persons sharing their stories of successful recovery from mental health challenges or suicidal thoughts. It also proposes working with social media companies to increase their awareness and improve their protocols for identifying and removing harmful content.Fostering socio-emotional life skills in adolescents is the focus of WHO’s Helping adolescents thrive  (HAT) guidelines. While adolescence (10–19 years of age) is a critical period for acquiring socio-emotional skills, it is also a period of risk for the onset of mental health conditions. Rather than focusing explicitly on suicide, the HAT guidelines recommend that programmes employ a positive mental health approach. Other recommendations include training for education staff, initiatives to ensure a safe school environment (such as anti-bullying programmes), links to support services, clear policy and protocols for staff when suicide risk is identified, and increasing parental awareness of mental health and risk factors. Teachers or caregivers should be reminded that talking about suicide with young people will not increase suicide risk but will mean that young people may feel more able to approach them for support when needed. The well-being of staff should also be ensured. Early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours. This advice is intended to ensure that people who are at risk of suicide, or who have attempted suicide, receive the support and care that they need. It applies to health workers and others, including family members, who are likely to come into contact with someone at risk. The advice also applies to health systems which need to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component in order to intervene early when people are found to be at risk of suicide. Additionally, support should be offered to people who have attempted suicide and those who have been bereaved by it. Since suicide prevention is often not a public health priority, the guide recommends advocating for suicide prevention with policy-makers, raising awareness in the community and providing evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of suicide prevention.A series of four annexes provides: 1) a list of sectors and stakeholders relevant to suicide prevention; 2) 30 boxes describing country activities for suicide prevention (in addition to the 43 descriptive boxes in the text of the guide); 3) the LIVE LIFE indicators framework that lists the goals, outcomes and indicators for LIVE LIFE; and 4) lists of WHO and non-WHO resources on suicide prevention, organized by: Situation analysis, Multisectoral collaboration, Awareness-raising and advocacy, Capacity-building, Financing, Surveillance, Monitoring and evaluation, Limit access to the means of suicide, Interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide, Foster socio-emotional life skills in adolescents, and Early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",

      "LIVE LIFE  |  1INTRODUCTION\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Over 700 000 people lose their life to suicide every year. People from all socioeconomic backgrounds are affected. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds and the third in 15–19-year-old girls. The majority of deaths by suicide (77%) occur in low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Every suicide is a tragedy, with far-reaching impact on families, friends and communities. Reducing the number of deaths by suicide around the world is a global imperative and global targets have been set. Reducing the global suicide mortality rate by one third by 2030 has been included as an indicator and target (the only one for mental health) in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)\n",
      "3 and in the WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013 –2030. WHO’s 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13) 2019–2023\n",
      "4 includes the same indicator with a reduction of 15% by 2023.There has been a small reduction in the global age-standardized rate of suicide since 2010 but the global trend masks regional and country-level variations; not all countries are committed to suicide prevention, and some have seen suicide rates increase. The world is not on track to reach the global targets by 2030. This means that, unless there are accelerated and sustained efforts made to prevent suicide, the global targets will not be met and many more people will unnecessarily lose their life.Much more needs to be done to reduce the number of people who die by suicide. Consequently, WHO has developed this guide to support countries to implement key effective evidence-based interventions following the WHO LIVE LIFE approach for preventing suicide as a starting point.WHO advocates for countries to take action in preventing suicide, ideally through a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. A government-led comprehensive national strategy is a powerful tool which helps to ensure that the government and other stakeholders are committed to prevent suicide in a country, that there is coordination and monitoring of their efforts, that suicide prevention is placed high on the political agenda, and that resources are allocated to make it possible to implement the necessary actions. Although there has been progress and some countries have been very active in suicide prevention, only 38 countries were known to have a dedicated national suicide prevention strategy in 2018 (WHO, 2018a). Additionally, governments often underestimate the importance of coordinating implementation after the national strategy has been adopted. In the field of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), implementation gaps for national action plans have been attributed to inadequate funding, limited capacity, inaction across sectors, and lack of standardized monitoring and evaluation (Tuangratananon et al., 2019). Indeed, evaluations of national suicide prevention strategies are largely lacking.The absence of a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy should not stop countries from implementing interventions for suicide prevention. In many countries that have no strategy, a wide range of stakeholders are engaged in suicide prevention activities – from organizing survivors’ support groups to awareness-raising and advocacy for at-risk populations. Community stakeholders (see Annex 1 for a list of sectors and stakeholders) will benefit from implementing any of the LIVE LIFE components; their implementation can form the beginnings of suicide prevention in a country, gaining momentum with the potential to grow into a national response for suicide prevention. Therefore, both governments and communities contribute to suicide prevention when implementing LIVE LIFE through top-down and bottom-up processes respectively.LIVE LIFE is WHO’s approach to get implementation started and to emphasize the scale-up to national level of four key evidence-based suicide prevention interventions, namely:• limit access to the means of suicide (e.g. ban highly hazardous pesticides);• interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide;• foster socio-emotional life skills in adolescents; and• early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours.  \n",

      "-----------------\n",
      "2  |  LIVE LIFEThe successful implementation and scale-up of these key interventions needs, as a prerequisite, six cross-cutting core foundational pillars, namely:• situation analysis;• multisectoral collaboration;• awareness-raising and advocacy;• capacity-building;• financing; and• surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.In addition to contributing independently to the reduction of suicide, the combination of implementing all the LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions will have a synergistic effect in which different components interact to produce additional benefits (Harris et al., 2016; Yip & Tang, 2021). For example, an awareness-raising event could increase uptake of training for capacity-building, leading in turn to increased early identification for suicidal behaviours.There is a need to work towards full implementation of LIVE LIFE in all countries and contexts. LIVE LIFE serves as a starting point upon which countries can build further evidence-based suicide prevention interventions to develop a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. All pillars and interventions described in this LIVE LIFE guide are components for a national response and would typically be part of a national suicide prevention strategy. Countries with a national strategy, or where suicide prevention is integrated into existing relevant action plans – such as those for mental health, alcohol or NCDs – will benefit from ensuring that their strategies or action plans are implemented, prioritizing implementation of these components.\n",

      "A Steering Committee (or oversight committee, or task force) is needed to provide leadership and coordination as well as to structure planning, resourcing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating LIVE LIFE.Working groups (sub-branches of the Steering Committee) would be convened to lead implementation on individual pillars and interventions. One member of the Steering Committee should maintain consistency and facilitate coordination.At both levels persons should be included who represent authority, administration and technical expertise. Ideally, there should be collaboration between public, private and community groups or individuals (see Annex 1 for a list of sectors and stakeholders). The following should be included:• individuals in leadership positions in relevant sectors (e.g. health care, education, employment, social development);• individuals with expertise in suicide prevention [e.g. academic experts, health sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)];• individuals with skills and experience specific to the pillar or intervention in question (e.g. a working group for situation analysis should include persons with skills in data collection and analysis, while a working group for interacting with the media should include persons from media regulation bodies or NGOs with experience of engaging with the media); and• people with lived experience (who have experienced suicidal thoughts, made a suicide attempt, cared for a loved one during a suicidal crisis, or been bereaved by suicide).The importance of establishing clear leads of the Steering Committee and working groups should not be underestimated. Similarly, explicitly defining roles and responsibilities of group members is necessary to ensure accountability for actions taken. It is not necessary to have 10 separate working groups for LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions as one working group may sequentially address several pillars or interventions, depending on resources and time constraints. Ultimately, the working groups lead the planning and implementation of LIVE LIFE, in coordination with the Steering Committee. Working groups responsible for monitoring the implementation of LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions – e.g. developing a schedule for when actions need to be completed and periodically convening to review progress in order to address difficulties early . Working groups should be prepared to report evaluations to the Steering Committee on the plans that have been put into practice.INTRODUCTION\n",

      "• Countries should implement all the LIVE LIFE core pillars and key interventions.• Although all core pillars and key interventions are needed for suicide prevention, each country can adapt its implementation to the availability of resources and the sociocultural context.• The LIVE LIFE core pillars and key interventions are not intended to be implemented in a chronological order. There is no established specific order, although one should ideally begin with a situation analysis and bear in mind that surveillance and monitoring should be ongoing.\n",
      "• Accordingly, although the chapters of this guide are interconnected, each one could be considered an independent module and countries could start with the module most relevant to them. This decision will be guided by the situation analysis, which should be used as the first step.• Implementing all the LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions nationally will benefit a national suicide prevention strategy or become part of it.• In contexts with limited human and financial resources it may be necessary to implement or scale up LIVE LIFE over a longer period and take action on country priorities first.How the guide is used will vary according to the context and current state of suicide prevention. If the foundational pillars are already up and running, one can tackle the implementation of the key interventions directly. In other circumstances one may need to start with preparing the ground for suicide prevention or on a small scale. At any rate, a Steering Committee and working groups should be established (see Box 1). For public health emergencies or other emergency situations, some considerations have been compiled, but are not exhaustive (see Box 2).\n",
      "Box 2. Suicide prevention in emergencies\n",
      "Humanitarian crises and emergencies (e.g. natural disasters, armed conflict, public health emergencies) pose a number of barriers to suicide prevention such as structural changes in leadership and systems, change in priorities, issues of safety and resource constraints. Yet risk factors for suicide – such as financial difficulties, unemployment and social isolation – can increase during emergencies and therefore efforts to focus on suicide prevention are vital. Under these circumstances, contexts may need to focus on immediate and feasible priorities for suicide prevention (Gunnell et al., 2020). While a comprehensive discussion of suicide prevention in crisis situations is beyond the scope of this guide, some considerations include: • Governments should consider the impact of the emergency on risk factors for suicide and should implement mitigation through multisectoral collaboration – e.g. working with the labour and welfare sectors, health sector and humanitarian actors to support individuals in financial distress; restricting access to the means of suicide (such as regulations or guidelines for retailers or camp managers); and facilitating access to mental health support and other emotional or crisis support services.• Governments hosting persons affected by emergencies, including refugees and migrants, should consider these persons’ specific risk factors and needs as part of suicide prevention efforts.\n",
      "• Identify and provide effective interventions for at-risk populations who may be particularly affected during the emergency – such as young people or older persons who may have lost, or are separated from, family support.\n",
      "• Engage the media to minimize sensationalized reporting of suicides which occur in the affected community during the emergency. \n",
      "• Build the capacity of the existing health and community workforce in early identification, assessment, management and follow-up of suicide risk. Community gatekeepers and non-specialist health workers should feel confident to identify, support and refer individuals at risk of suicide, including implementing psychological intervention designed for use in adverse settings (WHO, 2016b). Services where individuals at risk would present can be prioritized, such as primary health care services and programmes focused on addressing concerns about protection (including child protection and gender-based violence).• Where in-person mental health support is limited, establish systems for remote support (WHO, 2018c).

      "WHY?\n",
      "A situation analysis is essential for informing the planning and implementation of suicide prevention activities. The situation analysis can identify where there is most need, where there are gaps or where the benefit will be greatest (e.g. which means or populations to focus on). The analysis can safeguard against duplicate implementation efforts and identify where immediate and feasible actions can be taken.\n",
      "WHERE?\n",
      "A situation analysis can be conducted nationally or in a regional or local context – such as a district or other specific setting (e.g. a refugee camp or school). In a national situation analysis, attention should be given to collecting information from different sociodemographic groups and regions to identify specific needs for adapting the implementation of the LIVE LIFE interventions. For example, ingestion of pesticides occurs primarily in agricultural areas of low- and middle-income countries; therefore restricting access to this means of suicide may be less applicable in urban areas.WHEN?\n",

      "High suicide rates and a lack of evidence-based information on suicide prompted the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) of Namibia to conduct a national situation analysis in 2018 to guide prevention and treatment strategies.The study focused on a number of outcomes, including:• prevalence of fatal suicides and nonfatal suicide attempts;• prevalence of suicidal ideation (thoughts);• causes of suicide;• knowledge and attitudes towards suicide and suicide prevention and treatment efforts; and• availability and effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts.A working group was formed from representatives of the MoHSS, the Namibian Statistics Agency and Sustainable Development Africa (a Namibian socioeconomic research firm). An inception meeting was held to agree on the objectives and methodology of the study. Social workers from the MoHSS were trained as data collection officers and a pilot test was conducted before commencing the full analysis.The analysis was conducted nationally and involved both qualitative and quantitative research methods, including:• a review of national and international research, policies and programmes; • review of suicide records from the Namibian Police;• quantitative surveys of randomly selected individuals across different regions; and• qualitative interviews with key informants at national, regional and local levels (e.g. government staff, police, health and social care staff, educational and spiritual leaders); people who had previously attempted suicide; and focus group discussions with randomly selected adults and youth.The results of the study generated a number of recommendations and were used to inform the development of a Five Year National Strategic Plan on the Prevention of Suicide in Namibia and the development of a policy framework to guide suicide prevention, treatment, management and coordination (Namibian Ministry of Health and Social Services, 2018).\n",

Utilize a succinct model such as Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT).• Consider consulting with national and international experts on key documents and existing data. • Where human resources are not available (e.g. expertise to analyse data), consider collaborating with individuals, organizations or persons in academia who are working, or have previously worked, on situation analyses in other settings.\n",
      "Data security and confidentiality• The primary ethical consideration in the use of suicide data is to protect the privacy of individuals. This means that no personal data must be disclosed in an identifiable form.• There are known risks in the dissemination of information on the means or common locations of suicide. Stakeholders who have access to sensitive data within the situation analysis must agree to uphold data confidentiality and adhere to an agreed communications plan for dissemination of information.\n",

      "MULTISECTORAL COLLABORATION\n",
      "WHAT?\n",
      "Suicide prevention cannot be addressed by the health sector alone as risk factors associated with suicide and its prevention cut across many areas. For suicide prevention to be effective, a multisectoral approach is critical. For the purpose of this guide, multisectoral collaboration refers to both multisectoral and multi-stakeholder approaches:• Multisectoral approaches are sometimes described as “whole-of-government”, “intersectoral” or “cross-sectoral” – i.e. any initiative that includes more than one government sector, such as health, education, labour, transport, agriculture, justice, law, defence, social development.• Multi-stakeholder approaches are sometimes described as “whole-of society” approaches. Unlike multisectoral approaches, they include collaboration with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or community stakeholders, as well as with government sectors.Implementation of LIVE LIFE requires such collaboration. For instance, in restricting access to the means of suicide, collaboration will be needed between sectors related to the means in question (e.g. Ministry of Agriculture in the case of highly hazardous pesticides) and stakeholders (e.g. registrars, retailers, farmers). Another example would be school-based interventions where collaboration would include the Ministry of Education and stakeholders such as school heads, teachers, students, parents/caregivers and youth associations.It is necessary to work across multiple government departments to develop policies, legislation or programmes which have an impact on suicide. For instance, departments responsible for health, mental health, alcohol,\n",

      "SITUATION ANAL YSISBox 5. Decriminalizing suicide, Ireland\n",
      "Suicide in Ireland was decriminalized in 1993, an act that precipitated Ireland’s suicide prevention activities. In the years prior to the decriminalization of suicide in Ireland, there was an increasing public debate about suicide and suicide prevention, supported by emerging research led by a small number of psychiatrists. A member of the Irish Parliament (Dáil Éireann) supported by two psychiatrists had put forward multiple motions to the Government to allow a debate on decriminalizing suicide; up to then suicide had been the “silent taboo” in Irish society. On 1 July 1993, President Mary Robinson signed into law a bill to decriminalize suicide and attempted suicide. The decriminalization of suicide was one of the first steps in Irish society to recognize that suicide and mental health conditions are serious public health issues. It was the beginning of the long road to remove stigma from suicide, self-harm and mental health conditions – a process that is still ongoing. The decriminalization of suicide and opening-up of the discussion on suicide prevention led to the formation of NGOs to raise understanding of the complexity of mental health and suicide. In 1995, the National Suicide Research Foundation was established. In 1996, the Irish Association of Suicidology was formed to provide accurate information and advice on suicide and self-harm to all involved in the prevention and containment of the harm arising from suicide and self-harm. The decriminalization of suicide facilitated the development of Ireland’s first National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, which represented the first coordinated response to suicide. This was followed by the first National Suicide Prevention Strategy, Reach Out, 2005–2014, supported by the Department of Health. In 2015, the second strategy, Ireland’s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide, Connecting for Life, 2015–2020, was launched, with an agreed four-year extension until 2024.\n",
      "Engagement with community stakeholders is essential to multisectoral collaboration (see Annex 1 for a list of sectors and stakeholders). It helps to build bridges between local needs and national policies, and it helps to ensure that initiatives are adapted to the local context. Community engagement can also foster a sense of participation and collective ownership of Box 6. The influence of circumstances on multisectoral efforts to prevent suicide, Suriname\n",
      "In response to the high rate of suicide in the country a task force was established, headed by the District Commissioner (the highest representative of the government) to whom the group would report, and chaired by the head of the Medical Psychology department with practical coordination led by a public health specialist. The local departments of the Ministries of Health, Education and Agriculture participated, as did grass-roots organizations, medical doctors and local women’s organizations. Many social and educational activities were organized. The group was tasked with developing the first national suicide prevention strategy in line with the National Mental Health Action Plan 2014–2020 that had already been developed. In June 2016 a National Strategy was published that was supported by the Council of Ministers. The focal point for mental health had an important role. The focal point’s strength in maintaining relationships and regular persistence meant that pressure was kept on the issue of suicide prevention. However, very soon after publication the country plunged into a deep economic recession, and the focal point who had been instrumental in maintaining government interest in suicide prevention was unable to stay in the post and was not replaced. The recession also affected the infrastructure that had been put in place for suicide prevention, much of which was closed down. The former members of the task force lost enthusiasm and lost executive power to implement the most important aspects of the strategy. Formally, the group was dissolved. Yet, after some time the former chairman expressed concern to the (newly appointed) Minister of Health about the state of the strategy. To everyone’s joy in 2018, a new focal point for mental health was appointed and efforts for implementing suicide prevention in Suriname now continue with force.suicide prevention. Multisectoral collaboration in all its forms will not thrive without clear governance and leadership to move the process forward. A successful example, documenting a chronology of actions from government level to engagement of local stakeholders, comes from Sri Lanka (Pearson et al., 2010; Pearson et al., 2015).\n",

      "SITUATION ANAL YSISWHY?\n",
      "Because suicide is a complex issue, prevention efforts require coordination among multiple sectors and stakeholders, with good governance to facilitate strategic planning. Multisectoral collaboration enables knowledge-sharing, exchanges of methodology and lessons learned from previous work, with sharing of suicide-related data and research (Kolves et al., 2021) and coordination of messaging about suicide. Multisectoral collaboration provides opportunities for the integration of suicide prevention into other programmes (such as mental health, alcohol, NCDs, gender-based violence and child protection). For countries with limited resources, collaboration may provide a starting point to work opportunistically with what is already available. Increased coordination between different groups working on suicide prevention and related areas will make the work more streamlined, resulting in less duplication of effort and pragmatic use of resources.Multisectoral collaboration fosters transparency and strengthens the accountability of partners involved, while communities are meaningfully engaged to ensure that prevention activities meet the needs of all people. Multisectoral collaboration does not require extensive funds, yet the act of communicating about shared goals and coordinating efforts should result in accelerated progress and improved quality of suicide prevention.\n",

      "Multisectoral collaboration is required both for the core pillars and the key interventions of LIVE LIFE. Leadership should come from the government (usually the Ministry of Health), and it must be complemented by engagement with sectors and stakeholders at all levels, such as national and local authorities, administrators, and individuals/organizations in the community . For example, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, regular intersectoral meetings are led by the governor of each district with key departments represented (health, agriculture, welfare, police, legal medicine, charity, education) to discuss achievements and challenges.\n",
      "Box 8. Local adaptations for local implementation and priority populations\n",
      "In settings where local government authorities provide effective leadership, local action plans are one pathway from a national suicide prevention strategy to tailored and coordinated implementation in local and priority population contexts. Local plans should be tailored to the needs and available resources of the local community , which may differ from those identified at the national level.Japan is an example where, based on the National Suicide Prevention Action Plan, local municipalities and prefectures are required by law to develop local plans for implementing suicide prevention measures. This was considered a desirable approach to accelerate efforts to prevent suicide in Japan as local authorities are closer to residents in a community. Guidance provided has specified the role of prefecture authorities (who cover multiple municipalities) in supporting the work of local municipalities. The government and the Japan Support Center for Suicide Countermeasures (JSSC) support local government planning, both financially and technically.Public Health England supported all local areas to develop multi-agency suicide prevention plans, with all areas having a plan in place by April 2019. The implementation of the National Health Service (NHS) Mental Health Services Implementation Plan 2019/20–2023/24 includes ring-fenced funding to support delivery of the multi-agency suicide prevention plans. These plans include all key local statutory agencies and the voluntary sector in ongoing local efforts to prevent suicide. The local strategies and plans describe specific actions that will be taken across the respective agencies (based on the English national strategy , guidance from NHS England and NHS Improvement and Public Health England, and national and local data) to reduce suicides in every local area in England. Success of this approach has been attributed to ensuring that detailed plans were submitted prior to the agreement of support funding; aligning local plans with national guidance; and offering learning-days where different sites in receipt of funding can learn from each other and share experiences. National and local efforts on suicide prevention continue to be a high priority for government and a national real-time suicide surveillance system is currently being developed, led by Public Health England. NHS England and NHS Improvement will launch the Mental Health Safety Improvement Programme, focusing support on mental health trusts to reduce the rates of suicide of people in contact with mental health services.\n",

      "In 2015, political support for suicide prevention in Bhutan was generated as a result of presenting Cabinet members and parliamentarians, chaired by the Honourable Prime Minister, with a report on the situational analysis of suicide in Bhutan. Considering the magnitude and seriousness of the issue, the government instructed the establishment of a dedicated programme/unit for suicide prevention. Following this, a nationwide study on reported suicide cases was carried out and formed the basis of the National Strategy Action Plan that was developed and was operational in 2016. A national suicide prevention programme was established in the Ministry of Health to coordinate the suicide prevention response across the country and to keep the stakeholders engaged in delivering suicide prevention services. As suicide prevention is multidimensional, involving various key stakeholders, a National Steering Committee was formed to provide thrust to the multisectoral response and to keep the government informed of the challenges, issues and progress of the suicide response. Responsible collaborating agencies from various departments were called upon as stakeholders to implement the suicide prevention action plan and to create a platform to discuss the progress, challenges and issues as well as the way forward. Stakeholders included: the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education (Department of Youth & Sports); Ministry of Home & Cultural Affairs (Department of Local Government); Royal Bhutan Police; Bhutan Narcotic Control Authority (BNCA); National Commission for Women and Child (NCWC); RENEW (NGO) – Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women; the media (television, national newspapers, radio); Ministry of Agriculture; KGUMSB (Kheser Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan); Bhutan Infocomm & Media Authority (BICMA); and Dratshang (Commission for the Monastic Affairs).WHEN?\n",

      "Box 10. Forming public–private partnerships, United States of America\n",
      "The Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in the USA is a public–private partnership which includes more than 250 partners and coordinates a comprehensive national response to suicide. In 2012, the Action Alliance brought together diverse public– private stakeholders including government representatives, national nonprofit organizations and public sector groups, suicide prevention experts, health-care providers and people with lived experience. The work of the National Alliance includes advancing the National Strategy, prioritizing three areas of work in strengthening care for suicide, strengthening community-based suicide prevention, and changing the national conversation on suicide. The work of the Action Alliance was made possible by several key factors. First, a leader within the federal government recognized the significant contribution that a strong public–private partnership could make to reducing suicide nationally and was willing to be a champion for the effort. Second, there was a willingness to engage multiple federal agencies and departments and to allow them to be equal partners in the initiative. Third, there was a willingness to make an initial investment of federal dollars and maintain that until private funding could also be leveraged. When the Action Alliance was launched on 10 September 2010, the high-level collaboration was vividly demonstrated by the presence of both the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Defence, by the willingness of the Secretary of the Army to serve as the public sector co-chair, and by the willingness of a former United States senator, who had lost his own son to suicide, to serve as the private sector co-chair. This high-level federal involvement also made it possible to engage private-sector leaders from multiple sectors in supporting the effort.The influence of high-ranking support in government has historically had tremendous impacts on the momentum of multisectoral collaboration for suicide prevention, and thus on the implementation of measures to save lives. A government-led approach signals that suicide prevention requires different government departments to work together, and that suicide prevention is not held only by the health sector. Such influence has been observed by the Presidential Task Force for suicide prevention in Sri Lanka, the Government of Japan, and the (first-ever) appointment of a minister for suicide prevention in the United Kingdom who by now manages the portfolio of suicide prevention, mental health and patient safety.\n",

In recognizing the need for a whole-of-government approach, a first-ever National Suicide Prevention Adviser was appointed in 2019, reporting directly to the Prime Minister . To support the work of the Prime Minister’s National Suicide Prevention Adviser, a National Suicide Prevention Taskforce was established in August 2019, with joint governance by the Department of Health and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and staf fed by secondees from a range of Commonwealth Government agencies. A Senior Executive Commonwealth Suicide Prevention Interdepartmental Committee was established to facilitate input and advice into the development of suicide prevention initiatives across the government.

Their expertise is critical to informing, influencing and enhancing all aspects of suicide prevention. Furthermore their involvement can help to provide models of hope for others who are experiencing or being affected by suicidal behaviours or who have lost someone to suicide. Every working group for each pillar and intervention should include people with lived experience who are actively involved in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation. All working groups should follow a participatory process which equally takes into account the voices of people with lived experience.This involvement is not tokenistic, and the views of people with lived experience are heard and valued through integration of their feedback into programme design, policy reform, and service enhancement or re-design. Sufficient time and resources should be allocated during planning of LIVE LIFE activities for engagement with people with lived experience.

      "1.  Form a steering group and develop a vision for collaboration (see Box 1, Introduction)• Identify individuals who will play a key role in the development and monitoring of collaborations. Decide on leadership that will be able to convene collaborators and coordinate activities. It is key to involve relevant budget holders, and national/local government leaders.• Consider the aims and scope of collaboration, understand what you hope to achieve through the collaboration, and establish what success will look like (see also Annex 3 and Monitoring and evaluation). • Plan for financing of the collaboration, taking into account, for instance, time, transport and activities.2.  Identify collaborators and decide on a method of engagement• Perform a collaborator mapping exercise (e.g. during situation analysis) considering the following items for potential collaborators: »role in LIVE LIFE; »current engagement with, and attitudes to, suicide prevention; »potential reasons/aversion to engaging in suicide prevention; »cultural or religious beliefs, social and economic circumstances and usual channels of communication; »relationships with other sectors/stakeholders; »power/influence to ensure there is engagement from all partners and that recommended changes are put into action; »what they can contribute to the collaboration effort (e.g. resources, skills);  »benefits for them of their involvement (that could be highlighted when attempting to engage them); »any issues related to their involvement (possible conflicts, barriers, constraints).• Decide on techniques for engaging collaborators, such as: »memorandums of understanding or cooperation (e.g. between government departments); »public meetings; »focus groups; »workshops; »individual meetings/interviews; »awareness-raising events;  »Internet (questionnaires, consultations, emails).3. Engage collaborators• When engaging with collaborators, discuss the following points: »the importance of suicide prevention; »the role of collaborators in suicide prevention; »potential benefits of their involvement for themselves and for LIVE LIFE implementation; »use of appropriate language; »respect for different perspectives; »any concerns they may have about being involved.4. Hold an initial collaboration meeting• Agree on the shared aims of collaboration.• Consider what each partner can bring to the collaboration (resources, skills, relationships/areas of influence), and whether collaborators have any requirements/constraints to be negotiated.• Define the roles and responsibilities of each collaborator.• Develop clear guidelines/rules for the collaboration and define procedures to follow should these not be met.• Formulate a plan of action: identify a set of short- and medium-term actions that can be prioritized initially, with a timeline for completion in the long-term.

      "In Chennai, south India, a nondescript building in a narrow tree-lined lane houses an organization that has saved uncountable lives. The volunteers of this NGO, SNEHA, themselves would not know how many they have brought back from the precipice of suicide. As students of psychiatry we had little to offer for other conditions, but for something which was preventable like suicide, nobody was doing anything and this prompted the start of SNEHA.At the beginning of SNEHA in 1986, suicide was a subject tainted with social stigma. The going was initially tough as the concept of volunteerism, emotional support and suicide prevention was poor – so much so that finding a place to rent was difficult. Slowly and steadily the work of SNEHA came to be recognized by the public, media and mental health professionals. Over the decades, SNEHA branched out beyond being a suicide helpline to raising awareness in the community, addressing policy issues and developing innovative community interventions to reduce suicides. In the early 2000s, SNEHA volunteers began noticing that every year in June, the number of callers increased. Volunteers were running 24-hour shifts to manage the distress calls from students who were suicidal due to failure in examinations during this period. Most students who died by suicide had failed in only one or two subjects. Yet, it was not enough to listen with compassion – policy needed to be changed if young lives were to be saved. We lobbied very hard with the state government of Tamil Nadu to bring in supplemental examinations whereby students could re-take the examination within two months and not lose an academic year. There was extensive support from the media.In late 2002, the Tamil Nadu government announced the introduction of special supplemental examinations for students who had failed in up to three subjects. This was implemented in 2003, although the new policy was not publicized until late 2004. Once the state created awareness of the supplemental exams, the number of student suicides reduced by almost 50%. Just the fact that they had a second chance seemed to make a vast difference. Hope, it seems, worked wonders and several other states have followed suit.The increasing numbers of suicides within the population of Sri Lankan refugees living in Tamil Nadu prompted another NGO to approach SNEHA to address this issue. A low-cost peer delivered intervention called Contact and Safety Planning (CASP) was designed. At the end of the first year, suicidal behaviour was significantly reduced in the intervention refugee camp (Vijayakumar et al., 2017). SNEHA’s community intervention strategies have always been low-cost, non-labour intensive and based on peer support. In effect, these strategies can be successfully replicated all over the world.In 2017, after decades of lobbying by SNEHA with the Indian government on the need to decriminalize attempts to take one’s life, the colonial era law was finally made redundant by the passage of the Mental Health Act. SNEHA has also advocated ceaselessly for a national suicide prevention strategy at the highest government levels, including the Ministry of Health. As a result of these efforts, a committee was formed, and a National Action Plan has been drafted. The story of SNEHA is at the same time a story of how the loss of young lives to suicide is not ignored, and immediate and urgent action to save lives is taken. It shows how far community action can reach.\n",

      "In 1995, Sri Lanka was highlighted by the international community as having the highest suicide rate in the world. Hence, the then President appointed a Presidential Task Force to combat suicide in Sri Lanka in 1997. A crucial factor in the success of the Task Force was the authority of the President in appointing it resulting in all sectors collaborating with the utmost degree.The multisectoral Task Force comprised representatives from health, education, agriculture, social development, social services, universities and NGOs which provided community services. The main reasons for success of this multisectoral collaboration were the composition of the Task Force, the enthusiasm of the chair and the authority appointing it. In addition there was a balance of administrative authorities involved (such as the pesticide registrar, the director of the Samurdhi (development finance) authority, and the director of the health education bureau) along with technical experts (such as public health officials, sociologists and psychiatrists). The Task Force based its recommendations on evidence and consensus.The Task Force not only recommended interventions to prevent suicide, but also continued to monitor implementation of the recommendations at the grassroots level for several years thereafter. Key ingredients of success of the implementation at community level included the collaborative approach between the Task Force and communities, a dedicated programme to address the determinants of suicide in villages, and monitoring and evaluation.In Sri Lanka, it was important to tap into the resources of the political authority at the right moment in order to get things done. For other countries similar to Sri Lanka, public health professionals should be prepared to advocate at the highest levels of authority, basing their actions on the best available evidence adapted to cultural contexts.\n",

They think suicide prevention belongs only in the health sector• Use advocacy to show that suicide prevention goes beyond the health sector and requires collaboration.• Recognize suicide prevention as an issue in its own right, allowing for consideration of all underlying risk factors and not just mental health conditions.\n",
      "• Engage in regular meetings with other sectors and stakeholders to emphasize the ethical, political and economic value of suicide prevention, and involve them in awareness-raising.• Increase the budget for suicide prevention in other sectors to enable their participation. Allocate specific budgets to specific LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions so that these can be adequately resourced, rather than being considered a routine activity of the sector in question.• Provide regular feedback to stakeholders on successful prevention activities to retain engagement and momentum.• Consider incorporating suicide prevention in other public health policies and programmes which are prioritized (e.g. mental health, alcohol, violence prevention).• Where there is stigma, engage partners in awareness-raising discussions, provide information and dispel myths about suicide.• Find champions (i.e. people who care a lot about suicide prevention and are willing to take a leadership role) who can help to engage peers. It is preferable to have more than one champion because people’s roles change over the course of implementation.Table 3.

      "AWARENESS-RAISING AND ADVOCACYWHAT?\n",
      "Awareness-raising and advocacy are crucial activities for often-neglected public health problems such as suicide prevention. Public health awareness-raising is an organized process of communication that targets a public audience to increase knowledge and change attitudes, beliefs or behaviours on a public health topic of importance. Advocacy can be combined with awareness-raising to advocate for necessary changes to address a problem. By improving awareness, both communities and countries will observe an increase in the demands for services and support. This means that people leading efforts on awareness-raising should be prepared for such an increase (see Early identify, assess, manage and follow up, and Capacity-building).Awareness-raising draws attention to suicide prevention with messages such as:• Suicide is a serious public health issue.• People affected can seek help.• How to identify and support someone at risk of suicide.• How to open a conversation about suicide and respond appropriately if someone is suicidal.Advocacy tries to bring about change, usually at the policy level, by advocating for:• more funding to be allocated to suicide prevention measures; • changes in legislation, such as decriminalization;• integration of suicide prevention into schools, workplaces, health systems;• a national suicide prevention strategy;• improved suicide and self-harm surveillance systems; and• resources and support for at-risk groups.It is important to note that the language used in awareness-raising does not normalize or stigmatize suicide (see Resources for advice on language use). While it can be acknowledged that suicidal thoughts may occur over the life course, the importance of providing and seeking support needs to be emphasized. Consider not only what you communicate but also how you communicate it. Ensure that messaging addresses myths and misconceptions, and that it uses language which is neither sensational nor inflammatory.\n",
      "WHY?\n",
      "Awareness-raising and advocacy are strategic actions which contribute to overall suicide prevention efforts by influencing decision-makers and public opinion, attitudes and behaviours.For decision-makers, advocacy can:• contribute to increased political commitment and increased resource allocation for suicide prevention measures; and• be used to influence non-health stakeholders about their role in suicide prevention, including, but not limited to, agriculture, transport, judiciary, the community, and the private and labour sectors.\n",

The requests are a clear indication of the interest that is generated by Befrienders Kenya’s efforts in awareness creation on suicide and suicide prevention. In response, Befrienders Kenya provides training such as that for gate-keepers at the community level to equip specific community groups with the necessary knowledge and skills which contribute to reduction of stigma and promotion of help-seeking behaviour – thus contributing to suicide prevention efforts.

      "Awareness-raising and advocacy for suicide prevention can range from events conducted in a single community location (such as a village or workplace) to nationwide public communication campaigns. Advocacy for change can be integrated in awareness-raising (such as joint meeting events with government and NGOs). Messaging can be disseminated though a widely accessible and commonly used channel for a community (such as a radio broadcast, or in a community or faith meeting), or through multiple channels to reach diverse audiences and improve geographical reach in a country (such as social media, printed media, television, radio, press briefings, conferences or workshops, printed advertisements or billboards).\n",

Persons with experience in awareness-raising (e.g. in other areas of public health) should be included.Suicide prevention champions can accelerate awareness-raising and advocacy efforts. Champions can be influential or recognized members of a community (such as a faith leader, or local politician) or national or global celebrities who have demonstrated commitment to, and interest in, mental health and suicide prevention – such as Heads Together led by The Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \n",

      "One of the key strategic aims of the Scotland Government’s suicide prevention action plan is to ensure that suicide is no longer stigmatized. Wider efforts to reduce the stigma and discrimination around mental health support this aim, as well as two other strategic aims – i.e. that people at risk of suicide feel able to ask for help, and that people affected by suicide are not alone. Removal of the stigma around asking for help for a mental health problem or when in distress is vital to ensure that people can speak about how they are feeling before they reach a point where suicide feels like an option. See Me, Scotland’s programme to end mental health stigma and discrimination, focuses its work on the reduction of inequalities and a mental health inclusion approach in three core areas. In education, young people and the adults in their lives are offered a common language to speak about mental health, so that young people are not scared to speak out. In workplaces, employers work with See Me to improve policies and practices which can cause discrimination, as well as changing cultures so that employees feel able to say they are struggling and can have reasonable adjustments put in place to support them. In health care, See Me has worked to promote the involvement of people with lived experience of distress in the training of health-care staff so that the latter are aware of the negative impact of giving a noncompassionate and dismissive response. This work is supported by partners in local areas, intersectoral partners and those focusing on high-risk groups who, together with a growing social movement of people all across Scotland, are changing the culture around mental health in Scotland so that people do not feel alone and can ask for help when in distress.\n",

Determined and committed champions, United States of America\n",
      "In 1996 the United Nations issued a document entitled Prevention of suicide: guidelines for the formulation and implementation of national strategies. This document called on governments to formulate a national strategy for suicide prevention and to establish a coordinating body responsible for the prevention of suicidal behaviour. This call to action was heard by Jerry and Elsie Weyrauch of Marietta, Georgia who had lost their 34-year-old physician daughter Terri to suicide. They led a movement of survivors of suicide loss and allies and created a nonprofit organization called the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network USA (SPAN-USA) that has changed the response to suicide in the USA. The advocacy of this one couple from Georgia and the countless others who joined their crusade was instrumental in the development of the United States’  first national strategy. By bringing suicide to the attention of national legislators by engaging the voices of these many survivors, grief turned to action, pain to promise, and hurt to hope. In 1997, after US Senator Harry Reid shared his own story of having lost his father to suicide many years earlier, the Weyrauchs contacted his office to ask for his support in introducing a Resolution (S.Res.84) calling for acknowledgement of suicide as a national problem that warranted a national response and calling for the development of a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. This Resolution passed unanimously the day it was introduced, being approved by all 100 United States senators, and launched the country’s current movement to address suicide as a leading cause of death. In 1998 a national meeting was held in Reno, Nevada which called together survivors, academics, policy-makers, clinicians and others to lay the groundwork for our first national strategy for suicide prevention. After an initial Call to Action released in 1999, the first strategy was released in 2001, was revised in 2012, and the coordinating body was established in 2010. As Margaret Mead once said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’ s the only thing that ever has.” It is championship like that of Senator Harry Reid, Jerry and Elsie W eyrauch and Senator and Mrs Gordon Smith that have lifted the veil of secrecy from suicide and sparked a nation to take critical steps to commit to addressing this public health challenge. Because of their tireless efforts and selfless service, there is now a national strategy for suicide prevention, a coordinating body to oversee its implementation, a national suicide prevention resource centre, a national lifeline, an infrastructure to address suicide across the country and grants being distributed to assist communities in addressing suicide in their localities. These persons will always be remembered for their catalytic efforts, coming from their own losses of loved ones, to ensure that a country responds to the health challenge of suicide.\n",

      "Some people say that time heals all wounds. We believe that it is both time and action that help us heal after loss. In the midst of the grief that we faced after losing our younger son Taba to suicide, we started reaching out to fellow survivors – people suffering after the loss of a loved one to suicide like us. We strived to provide them with whatever limited support we could in order to guide them in their journey through grief and their efforts to fight off social stigma, while reminding them that they were not alone.Taba’s death transformed us completely. We realized that through sharing our own experience that we could help those who had experienced a similar loss to our own by showing them that they were not alone or abandoned. We soon learned through research and reflection that, contrary to local discourse, suicide is in fact preventable. In the absence of specialized governmental help and NGOs focused on the systematic prevention of suicide and the support of survivors, we decided to take action ourselves through the founding of Azhee.A few months after the official registration of Azhee as a nonprofit NGO in 2019, with support from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), we organized a national conference that coincided with W orld Suicide Prevention Day attended by approximately 100 suicide survivors, academics, national and international NGOs, diplomats, government representatives, and United Nations agencies. The conference succeeded in its objective of bringing heightened media and academic attention to the issue of suicide and the dire urgency of adopting efforts to prevent it. During the event, we reaffirmed the importance of finalizing a much needed, yet shelved, draft of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.In order to mark World Suicide Prevention Day this year, we hosted a remote workshop to launch the review process aimed at finalizing the draft strategy for government endorsement. Building on Azhee’s efforts, the Iraqi Council of Ministers’ Secretariat and IOM co-hosted Azhee and senior ministerial representatives in a two-day conference in Baghdad in November 2019 to consolidate our efforts towards finalizing the suicide prevention strategy. Though we have made progress since our inception, we continue to face challenges such as stigma at the personal and community levels, and the lack of funds at the organizational level. We remain committed to overcoming them in the years to come.Our son’s story ended, but ours did not. We founded Azhee (a Kurdish word that means s/he lives) because we are here celebrating the lives of the loved ones we lost to suicide and honouring the time they spent with us. We want others to appreciate and cherish their lives, live with happiness, and use their time on this planet to benefit both themselves and others. As the founders of Azhee\n",

      "Capacity-building is important so that people may obtain, improve and retain the skills and knowledge needed to do their jobs competently. Health services are often the entry point for people in distress where management and follow-up care are provided. Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship.\n",
      "30 Given that many people do not have sufficient access to health care (WHO, 2018b), it is also important to build the capacity of local gatekeepers, whose knowledge of and access to the community enables them to identify at-risk individuals and to mobilize support.\n",
      "WHERE?\n",
      "Capacity-building can be coordinated at the national level (e.g. training of national health, education, police workforce) or conducted in the community (e.g. training coordinated by a local body and directed towards specific community stakeholders). Training can be conducted face-to-face or digitally – using, for instance, suicide prevention e-learning courses on the virtual campus of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) 31, 32 or the WHO e-mhGAP application for non-specialized health workers in the assessment and management of self-harm/suicide.\n",
      "33\n",
      "WHEN?\n",
      "This work should be continuous throughout LIVE LIFE implementation. There may be strategic times to deliver capacity-building, such as by including suicide prevention in pre-service or continued training of health workers which is regularly reviewed during their employment. Capacity-building may also be triggered when problems arise, such as high rates of suicide in a particular occupational sector (such as construction) or stigma in the judicial sector.Before commencing initiatives, a care pathway for ongoing management and follow-up must be established (see Early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours). Capacity-building should be sustainable rather than having one-time training after which the effects of training effects may decline. Models which promote sustainability are the training-of-trainers model, the provision of supervision for health workers, or planning of training that is regularly repeated in the community.\n",

In response, the Centre for Suicide and Violence Research (CSVR) organized stakeholder meetings to discuss the need to expand awareness and knowledge of suicide to staff of the judiciary and related security services. To encourage the involvement of the judiciary, CSVR partnered with the Ghana Mental Health Authority to plan a training programme. A personal connection facilitated access to and buy-in from the judiciary services, who then joined planning discussions. Logistical arrangements for the training were made collaboratively. The training content included education on suicide, warning signs, stigma and the need for decriminalization of attempted suicide.\n",

      "Prompted by having one of the highest suicide rates in the world, the Government of Guyana made suicide prevention a priority. With technical support from PAHO/WHO, the National Mental Health Action Plan 2015–2020 and the National Suicide Prevention Plan 2015–2020 were developed and published in 2014. In May 2016, The Ministry of Public Health, established the Mental Health Unit to lead implementation of both plans and to organize the delivery of mental health services. One of the four strategic areas for the plan is to address the health system response to suicidal behaviour.mhGAP, developed by WHO for low- and middle-income countries, aims to scale up services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders. The mhGAP module on suicide and self-harm aims to train general health workers – such as those in primary care – in identifying and managing risk for suicide and providing appropriate follow-up care. In 2015, the Mental Health Unit of PAHO/WHO implemented the online course “Integration of mental health into primary care” based on the WHO mhGAP Intervention Guide, using PAHO’s Virtual Campus for Public Health platform. Seven physicians from Guyana successfully completed the first online course. One of the mhGAP trainees reported being “ better able to manage depression, using not only medication but also psycho education ”. This included identifying and understanding the stresses her patients were experiencing and exploring their social support system. Since then, more than 300 health-care workers have been trained to assess, manage and follow up common mental health conditions and suicide/self-harm. More than 100 of these are doctors located in primary health care. Additionally, 70 persons were also trained in the substance use module as alcohol and substance abuse are major risk factors for suicide in Guyana. In addition, teachers are being trained to recognize mental health issues in children and adolescents and to refer appropriately. Guyana’s next aspirations for gatekeeper training include a programme to involve non-health-care persons in suicide prevention.\n",

The programme was established with seed capital from the Building Employees Redundancy Trust (BERT), an employee entitlement fund jointly owned by construction employer associations and employee unions. The decision to establish an industry suicide prevention programme followed a report from a WHO Collaborating Centre in Brisbane – the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention – demonstrating significantly higher suicide rates amongst Queensland building industry workers (Heller , Hawgood & De Leo, 2007).MATES was established as an independent industry-based charity for the purpose of reducing suicide among construction workers. MATES is a multimodal programme (Gullestrup, Lequertier & Martin, 2011) based on four principles:• raising awareness among workers;• building resilience in the workplace;• connecting workers to help and support; and • informing industry about best practice in partnerships with researchers.The MATES programme is based on a community development model of continual improvement. MATES does not provide clinical services but seek to connect workers to the right resources at the right time. The basic building blocks of the MATES on-site programme related to capacity-building include:• General Awareness Training (GAT) – a one-hour programme designed to engage workers in suicide prevention and provided to all workers on site.

Key workers are trained as ASIST workers who are recognized by a blue hard-hat sticker.• Site accreditation – worksites meeting the minimum training requirements receive site accreditation.In addition, the basic building blocks include: 1) promotion of information material on sites for engagement (e.g. on W orld Suicide Prevention Day); 2) field officers to support the volunteer network; 3) on-site volunteers who inform management on site about mental health and suicide risk; 4) case management; 5) a 24/7 support line; and 6) national policy advocacy such as the Australian Building and Construction Industry Blueprint for Better Mental Health and Suicide Prevention which is a framework for better mental health endorsed by all major construction unions and employer associations in Australia.MATES has reached more than 220 000 workers across Australia and has more than 18 000 connectors and 2500 ASIST workers across more than 1000 worksites in Australia. The programme receives approximately 30% of its funding from government and 70% from industry. The programme is available at no charge to both employers and workers in the construction industry. The programme has demonstrated high social validity in the construction industry, improving help-offering and help-seeking skills, and reducing stigma.

In addition, the quality of care provided may be inadequate and inconsistent• Train specialized and nonspecialized health workers in the assessment, management and follow-up of suicidal behaviours and mental, neurological and substance use disorders and ensure these workers meet competency requirements.• Involving health workers in adapting the training to the local context can enhance motivation and the effectiveness of the training.• Understand the context-specific factors which hinder the management of suicidal behaviours, thus enabling training to be modified so that staff can be prepared to manage such challenges.Stigma or legal status of suicide may make trainees reluctant to participate\n",

      "FINANCING\n",
      "WHAT?\n",
      "Financing allows for LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions to be translated into action through the allocation of resources. Financing can originate from various public and private sources, such as government funding or philanthropic grants by private individuals, foundations, community groups or corporations.\n",
      "WHY?\n",
      "Unfortunately, dedicated funding for suicide prevention is scarce. Factors such as poor economic conditions, lack of prioritization of suicide as a serious public health issue, and lack of recognition that suicides are preventable result in a belief that funding for other areas is more important to society (see Awareness-raising and advocacy). One should not be disheartened by this, but instead should take a solution-focused approach by tailoring suicide prevention activities to the realities of the funding situation. This could mean taking an integrated approach (with mental health or other sectors) to qualify for multisectoral funding and increase likelihood of obtaining funds. It could also mean focusing efforts on cost-effective interventions with maximal reach, such as national bans on highly hazardous pesticides (Lee et al., 2021). Additionally, financing should be conceptualized to include a focus on the development and implementation of policies, strategies and plans, and not only on development of services. This is vital because LIVE LIFE includes pillars which are infrastructural and interventions that lend themselves to national policy and regulation (such as means restriction) as well as service development (such as early identification, assessment, management and follow-up).\n",
      "WHERE?\n",
      "Financing for suicide prevention can be provided towards implementation at the:• geographical level: national-level financing (e.g. for nationwide campaigns) or local-level financing (e.g. for delivering mental health services in a specific district);• stakeholder level: financing that targets specific at-risk populations or specific sectors or providers (such as schools, agriculture, community gatekeepers);• systems level: financing that targets broad-based activities that build the knowledge, capability and infrastructure of the sector at large (such as research, technology and capacity-building).Funders’ approaches may also involve a combination of the above levels, such as financing state-level research on suicide prevention in schools. Ultimately, LIVE LIFE implementers should understand the various sources of funding available and advocate to funders to align mutual values between implementers and financers.© WHO/Yoshi Shimizu\n",

      "40  |  LIVE LIFE: PART A\n",
      "FINANCINGWHEN?\n",
      "Funding needs and budgets should be clearly defined well before reaching the implementation phase of a suicide prevention pillar or intervention. Ideally, implementers would first build high-level strategic plans (to articulate goals and priorities for action), followed by detailed operational plans (to specify interventions to be carried out, costs, and the process for securing funds), fundraising or allocation of funds, and then implementation. The lack of well-defined plans can potentially lead to a perception that the work is not strategic, resulting in low success in acquiring funds no matter whether from government or other sources.While fundraising can be an ongoing activity, many funders have fixed grant cycles – a window of time within which they select grantees and disburse funding. For corporate bodies that donate a proportion of their revenue towards social activities, the end of the financial year is typically a time when they consider programmes to which they direct their funding. For foundations, grant cycles may vary and should be checked through their websites. Similarly, individual governments have their own budget cycles. Fundraising should not be a one-time or static effort. Once initial funding is secured, implementers can leverage this momentum towards mobilizing additional funds from a wider range of funders. There is no single approach to obtaining funds – all funders have their own process, structure and guidelines that must be individually researched and understood.\n",
      "WHO?\n",
      "Financing for LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions may come from various public and private players. National governments, as well as state or local governments, typically have some portion of their budget allocated to mental health programmes of which suicide prevention may be a component. Foundations often have greater appetite to fund innovative projects and to provide flexible and long-term capital. Many family foundations or individual philanthropists who focus their giving on suicide prevention are driven by personal experience. Initial private funding can be used to demonstrate effectiveness of an innovative intervention, which can then be leveraged to enabling the government to adopt the programme and scale its impact. HOW?\n",
      "1. Define budgets and articulate the need for funding• The national steering committee, or equivalent, will be the responsible body [see Box 1, Introduction].\n",
      "• Develop an operational plan or implementation plan that highlights details about interventions to be implemented, programme timelines and milestones, and human resources and funds required to carry out the work (see Annex 3).\n",
      "• Determine whether available financial resources will meet the needs and, if not, how much funding needs to be raised and over what period of time.• When defining budgets, clearly delineate personnel costs (salaries) and programme costs (travel, equipment, etc.) with clear and realistic cost figures against each. Also consider outlining not just direct costs of the programme but also indirect or overhead costs (utilities, rent, etc.), where relevant.2. Research the landscape of funders• Research which government sector or local and international funders support work on suicide prevention. Map funders who are supporting related work (e.g. mental health care, youth, pesticide-related programmes); many of these funders may not clearly present themselves as funders of suicide prevention work but could be interested in funding such programmes.• Approach philanthropy advisors or intermediary organizations who can help you navigate the landscape of funders of suicide prevention or related work.• Find out how your government’s funding works. Do government budgets for suicide prevention rest with national or regional governments, and within which departments?\n",
      "• Speak with nonprofit organizations and other implementers to understand their successes in obtaining funding.\n",
      "• Create a database of potential funders on the basis of your research.3. Identify government funding or suitable funders• Identify the government department and budget holder, or determine the type of funder, that would be most suitable given the nature of the intervention.  \n",

      "FINANCING• Identify which funders most strongly align with your vision, objectives and priorities. For instance, if you are seeking funding for suicide prevention for adolescents, seek funders who prioritize adolescent well-being and who have a history of funding similar programmes, or identify the budget holder in the relevant ministry or government department for education.\n",
      "• Check for alignment of the funders through websites and conversations. Make sure to identify potential conflicts of interest.• Understand the approximate size of grant that the funder would be ready to give. This can be gauged by researching the funder’s previous funding or having an initial conversation with the funder.• Identify and prioritize funders with whom you may already have built a strong relationship or professional connection.• Diversify your efforts to reaching out to multiple funders of various types.\n",
      "4. Develop proposals• On the basis of the funder’s requirements, you may need to use a fixed template provided by them or have the flexibility to create your own format for the proposal.\n",
      "• A proposal should cover the following: 1) information about you and your organization or government department; 2) the “why” (i.e. the context of the problem you are trying to address and why it is important); 3) the “what” (i.e. proposed objectives, interventions and activities); 4) the “how” (i.e. programme budget, timelines and key milestones); 5) the “who” (i.e. the team and partners who will be leading and implementing the work); 6) expected outcomes of the intervention with specific and measurable short-, medium- and long-term outcome indicators; and 7) the funding ask (i.e. how much funding, for what aspect of the work and over what duration).\n",
      "• Tailor the language and positioning of your proposal as closely as possible to the priorities of the funders.• If you have already secured some funding, share this information transparently with the funder. Funders often see value in investing in programmes and interventions that bring other resources to the table.• Preferably, send the proposal to the representative responsible for making decisions, rather than to a generic mail address.5. Present to funders• Ensure that team members who can speak effectively and in detail about the implementation work are present at the meeting with the funder.• Plan your key messages and structure your presentation to be succinct, specific and inspiring, with accompanying visuals and data. Policy-makers often have limited time and competing priorities, so a well-rehearsed, engaging and concise pitch is important.• Focus not only on the details of the programme or intervention, but also on why you think this is a significant mission-aligned opportunity for the funder to support the work. Also stress your history of success in suicide prevention. Box 24. Checklist: asking for funds from national and local budgets\n",
      "• Identify the key policy-maker responsible for decisions. • Identify the officials or systems responsible for implementing the policy decisions.• Seek an appointment at an appropriate place and time.• Keep the interaction focused and precise with a clear, concise and contextual message that speaks directly about prevention (do not discuss only the problem of suicide). Highlighting the burden of suicide as compared to that of other issues (e.g. road injuries) for which investment may be significantly greater can help call attention to the need for greater investment in suicide prevention.• Policy-makers usually have limited time and several competing priorities. To get their attention, do not give them a lengthy proposal with pages of data; deliver a understandable and brief (maximum two pages) note with sharp messaging focused on concrete results.\n",
      "• Offer your experience and expertise in suicide prevention.\n",

Consequently, the Centre for Suicide and Violence Research (CSVR) in Ghana struggled to obtain any funding from official sources to support its activities in providing education on suicide prevention. One of the key staff members at CSVR maintained a high media presence in order to strengthen awareness-raising and advocacy for suicide prevention and noticed that a philanthropic organization had been following his efforts. Persistent and determined, the CSVR repeatedly submitted its budget to the organization in the hope of garnering support. Even though they were not always successful, this persistence paid off, and the philanthropists saw the importance of the capacity-building work that CSVR engaged in. Crucially, to maintain the relationship, the CSVR continues to provide feedback to the philanthropists on the impact that their funding contributed to building capacity to prevent suicides in the country.Box 26.

A total of A$60 million has been provided to 12 identified trial sites across Australia for the NSPT over five years from 2016–2017 to 2020–2021. This funding was provided through relevant primary health networks (PHNs) as partner organizations at a total of A$5 million per site.PHNs were established in July 2015 to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services, particularly for patients at risk of poor health outcomes, and to improve coordination of care to ensure that patients receive the right care in the right place at the right time. As regional planning and commissioning bodies, PHNs were selected to lead trial activity to ensure it could be responsive to local needs.\n",

      "The Australian Government funded the NSPT to gather evidence on suicide prevention activities in local geographical areas of Australia, and to improve understanding of the most effective strategies in preventing suicide at local level and in at-risk populations. More specifically, its objectives were to provide evidence of how a systems approach to suicide prevention might best be implemented in Australia and to identify new learning about suicide prevention in at-risk populations.\n",
      "The NSPT was designed to allow trial sites to be flexible. Each trial site was required, at a minimum, to select one or more focus population groups in their region, to trial an evidence-based systems approach and to participate in the evaluation.\n",

Six focused on men, two on young people, two on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people, and one each on ex-ADF members and older adults. Some focused on specific subgroups in their chosen focus population (e.g. fishermen, farmers and miners, LGBTI youth, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth).• Keep the presentation conversational, invite the funder’s thoughts and build a relationship with them through the course of the presentation.6.  Maintain relationships with funders, irrespective of their funding decisions• If you were successful in securing funding, do not assume that the hard work is finished; in fact, it has just begun. To maximize the chance of the funder providing more funding to you in the future and to increase credibility among other potential funders, instil trust and confidence in the funder through regular, transparent and thoughtful communication. This may take place through frequent meetings, telephone calls, reports or progress updates that evaluate the implementation to show the impact that the funding has had.• If you were unsuccessful in securing funding, talk to the funder about what to improve for a future proposal. Stay in touch with the funder by providing regular updates on your work; continue looking for new opportunities.

      "Up-to-date data from established surveillance systems of suicide and self-harm are essential in informing LIVE LIFE pillars and interventions. Data on the number of suicides and cases of self-harm should be disaggregated at a minimum by gender, age and method (WHO, 2011; WHO, 2016a).These data can be collected from a number of different sources, such as:• Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system:\n",
      "38 \n",
      "Many countries have a CRVS system which formally records the occurrence and characteristics of deaths (and births). This provides continuous and comparable data, although it includes less detail about the circumstances of the death.• Health and police records: This involves collecting data from hospital- and mortuary-based records, and/or police, coroners and judicial records. In some contexts this will need to be done manually (e.g. by examining medical notes). While this approach takes time and money, it can provide accurate data. Where it is possible to utilize routinely collected data, this system can be relatively inexpensive and provides continuous and detailed information. However, hospital data capture only self-harm and deaths that happen in hospitals and may not identify well the means of suicide (e.g. the type of poison involved). Data on self-harm could also be obtained from outpatient, primary health care and community services.• Verbal autopsy:39 Such data can be collected through community-based reporting systems whereby health-care workers ask the family and friends questions about the circumstances surrounding the death. This is particularly helpful where vital registration systems or access to formal medical care are limited; it can also be used to validate information collected from other data sources and to provide more detailed information. Community surveillance involves a system for community members to report suicidal behaviour and can also be considered for collecting information on defined geographical areas or evaluations of a particular intervention. However, sufficient standardization is needed and there may be a risk of bias.• Population-based surveys: nationally representative surveys can be conducted specifically on suicidal behaviour or can be embedded in larger national or \n",

In fact, a comprehensive surveillance system for recording suicides and attempted suicides in rural India has been developed and utilizes data from community surveillance systems, hospital and police records (Vijayakumar et al., 2020).How surveillance is implemented will also depend on the current stage of suicide prevention in the country:\n",

The priority should be to begin with monitoring suicide mortality and then incorporating surveillance of self-harm. For countries which have poison centres, encouraging the sharing of data on intentional poisoning cases by individual centres to a central collection point may be informative: 1) for certain methods of suicide; and 2) to identify trends and new methods which may be amenable to means restriction. Situation analysis can be used to assess the current quality of surveillance and areas for improvement [see Situation analysis].Countries where a comprehensive surveillance system and CRVS are establishedIt is important to monitor key attributes such as data quality, coverage, timeliness and costs of the surveillance system in order to make improvements.

      "SURVEILLANCEWHY?\n",
      "Surveillance systems help to inform LIVE LIFE implementation, for instance by highlighting trends in suicidal behaviour, subpopulation groups at risk, clusters of cases, or the emergence of new methods or contagion methods of suicide that would need prompt action (Thomas, Chang & Gunnell, 2011). Data on suicide and self-harm also inform service provision, resource deployment and guidelines for managing suicidal behaviour by, for instance, ensuring that medical teams in specific locations are trained to manage the effects of certain means of suicide (e.g. pesticides), or employing specialized nurses in areas where many suicides occur. Data are used to monitor progress (e.g. indicator of reduced suicide rates) and contribute to the evaluation and research of ongoing prevention strategies and interventions, such as long-term cohort studies of self-harm cases presenting to hospitals in Oxford, United Kingdom.\n",
      "43 WHERE?\n",
      "Ideally countries should aim to collect data nationally to develop a full understanding of suicidal behaviour in the population. However, preference should be given to obtaining high-quality data from several representative locations rather than poor-quality data that cover the entire country. Surveillance may begin with smaller data sets that are representative of the national population (e.g. across a few key hospitals) and that can later be scaled up using the lessons learned. This may be particularly useful in large countries or where data are coordinated at a federal or regional level. Data collection may take place in a dedicated registry for self-harm, or it be part of a wider system of national data on mortality or injuries. Where data are collected nationally, it is important to aim for consistency between regions/localities on what data are collected and how this is reported.\n",
      "WHEN?\n",
      "Sustained surveillance should be included as a priority and should be set up before or at the beginning of LIVE LIFE implementation as it will allow countries to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions implemented. Data need to be collected continuously over the long term in order to provide timely, up-to-date (or where possible real-time) information on suicidal behaviours, and to enable the identification of changing patterns and persons at risk of repeated self-harm. However, where resources are very limited, surveillance may begin as an individual study of suicidal behaviour over a time-limited period in a specific area/population, which can then be scaled up to collect data continuously.\n",

      "The Russian Federation is one of the European Region countries where the national authorities recognize suicide as an important public health issue. To tackle this challenge and to enhance suicide monitoring and prevention within the mental health system, key health experts in Russia started collaboration with WHO’s Regional Office for Europe and the WHO Country Office in the Russian Federation, the results of which can be beneficial to other countries in the eastern part of the European Region. WHO’s self-harm surveillance approach has already been deployed in a number of English-speaking countries, such as Ireland, where it has shown its effectiveness in identifying vulnerable populations and enhancing access to needed health services. The pilot project in the Russian Federation aims to analyse positive practices at the national level and in parallel fine-tune and adapt the tool and methodology.As part of WHO, the Russian Federation’s collaboration under the Country Collaboration Strategy (CCS) is in line with the objectives of creating a comprehensive environment for prevention, for promoting health through a life-course approach and for strengthening capacity for global and regional cooperation in health. In consultation with the Serbsky Center, nominated as the key mental health institution in the Russian Federation and under Ministry of Health leadership, in 2018 experts from three Russian regions (the Ural Federal District, North Caucasian Federal District and Far Eastern Federal District) shared their experiences and expressed their readiness to showcase pilot sites on how they adapt and use a WHO tool and manual for improving monitoring and surveillance systems for self-harm and suicide attempts in hospitals.\n",
      "44 The tool is based on a set of WHO-recommended procedures that a trained health worker can follow to identify self-harm cases in hospitals and specialized health-care institutions. The initiative is aimed at creating a multicentred surveillance system on the basis of the Russian language version of the WHO tool to apply an online monitoring platform that can be used to gather and analyse high-quality data on self-harm and suicide attempts. The online software is currently being modified by health professionals in Stavropol Krai, North Caucasian Federal District. Setting up such a monitoring system can serve as a key step towards the enhancement of suicide prevention in any health system.As another result of the collaboration, WHO’s Regional Office for Europe and Russian health professionals have created training courses for facilitators of the surveillance and monitoring system. Use of the materials will facilitate the training health workers and data collectors who are needed to scale up the initiative to national and international levels. This set of WHO-recommended tools is harmonized with Russian health service standards at subnational level and has the capacity to be scaled up further. This initiative is intended to become an integral part of suicide and self-harm prevention infrastructure in the European Region, helping to improve access to mental health and other services for people at risk of suicidal behaviours.

      "1. Convene a working group (see Box 1, Introduction) • Establish the group (see under Who? above and Annex 1 for sectors and stakeholders).• Consider a steering committee to provide continuing support; a technical advisory group to provide guidance on planning, implementation and evaluation; and a surveillance management team to conduct the surveillance.• Inform key stakeholders about the necessity for surveillance of suicide and self-harm, and the need for continued support to maintain the system.2. Plan the surveillance system• Define the goals, objectives and scope of the system. Address, for instance, what information needs to be collected, how the information will be used for prevention, whether there are any pre-existing systems collecting similar information, and where the system should be situated.• Consider stepped implementation, beginning with a pilot phase and then scaling up to the national level.• Prepare a realistic budget of costs and resources required (e.g. for personnel, systems equipment, training, maintenance) and allocate primary and secondary funding options to sustain the system over time.• Identify processes for data collection, management and analysis. Address, for instance, what data will be collected, by whom, and where and how data will be stored. Develop standard operating procedures to maintain consistency.• For suicide mortality, aim for a CRVS system. For self-harm, aim at including it into routine medical records. As necessary, obtain required ethical approval from an ethics committee and permissions (e.g. from hospital management) for data collection from relevant data sources. Put safeguards in place to maintain confidentiality (i.e. no reporting of identifiable data).3. Prepare resources• Develop a data registration form or electronic data entry system, utilizing data coding and enabling the recording of data by event (as well as by person for suicide attempts). Include space for demographic details to enable identification of at-risk groups.• Prepare a manual to guide data collection and guarantee consistency over time.• Conduct training with data collectors, highlighting the importance of consistent definitions of suicidal behaviour, and practicing coding and data entry (particularly where available information may be ambiguous).• Meet and brief staff from whom data will be obtained (e.g. health-care managers) to encourage detailed assessment and record-keeping when they are managing people with suicidal behaviour.4. Pilot and implement the system• Pilot the data registration and collection in one or two locations to identify and resolve any issues.• Begin using the system in more locations.• Analyse the data periodically (ideally quarterly) to enable up-to-date summaries.5. Communicate findings• Write, publish and disseminate annual reports or smaller evidence briefs on a regular basis. Plan the release of annual reports at strategic times to increase visibility, such as on national or international suicide prevention days.• When designing reports of the data, consider the needs of stakeholders and the objectives of the surveillance system. Consider what type of reports should be generated, how often reports should be written, and who should receive them. Stakeholders may include policy-makers, health-care services, the general public, and the media (though caution will need to be used when reporting in the media; see Interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide).• Communicate key findings, including rates and specific trends in suicides and self-harm, and provide recommendations to inform prevention.6. Review and evaluate• Create a calendar for regular meetings and provide supervision to ensure that data collection is conducted according to operating procedures. It is important to make emotional support available to data collectors who will be exposed to emotive/graphic information on suicide.• In addition to ongoing monitoring, a detailed evaluation should be conducted periodically to determine how well \n",

      "Box 29. The self-harm and suicide registration system, Islamic Republic of Iran\n",
      "The Islamic Republic of Iran possesses a well-developed national self-harm and suicide registration system operating under the governance of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOH). According to system requirements, all medical universities countrywide are responsible for routine collection and registration of self-harm and suicide data related to their districts and catchment areas. This system was officially established as a stand-alone data gathering system in 2009 by the Department for Mental Health and Substance Abuse of the MOH in order to collect data on self-harm and suicide in a uniform manner. The system was modified in 2017 on the basis of the Practice manual for establishing and maintaining surveillance systems for suicide attempts and self-harm (WHO, 2016a).In 2009, an experienced mental health expert from each university participated in a national training meeting. Subsequently, data were collected from the medical universities after one mental health officer from each had been trained. A case report questionnaire in the form of a software with a users’ manual was prepared to ensure systematic and uniform portal data collection. The most important epidemiological correlates for designing suicide prevention interventions were covered. The questionnaire included demographic characteristics of the subjects such as gender, age, marital status, occupational status and educational level, previous history of mental and physical disorders, method of suicide and its outcome (adopted from previous related studies).The main sources of data on self-harm and suicide are official medical records from general hospitals and outpatient health facilities in cities and also from health houses and public health centres in villages. In rural areas some cases may be based on reports of local health workers who are aware of suicides in the area although they are otherwise not reported officially . Data from these sources is gathered in the district health centres, which are branches of medical universities in defined catchment areas of the provinces. Each university has access only to the data of its own district health centres while national data can be obtained only by the Department for Mental Health and Substance Abuse of the MOH which has responsibility of monitoring the data entry. According to official reports, some suicide cases may not be referred to health or medical centres. In these cases, corpses are referred to local forensic medicine headquarters for verification of the cause of death and the data are then compiled and officially reported to medical universities. These data are also added to the MOH data on a seasonal basis.\n",

      "SURVEILLANCEBox 30. Surveillance, White Mountain Apache Tribe, USA\n",
      "Currently, Native American communities struggle with the highest rates of suicide of any US ethnic group, particularly young people aged 15–24 years. In response to this public health concern, the White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) has developed an innovative approach to promote mental health and resiliency. Powered by their local tribal member workforce of community mental health specialists, the Celebrating Life model integrates referral, surveillance, prevention, crisis care and case management (Cwik et al., 2014; Cwik et al., 2016).Surveillance has been recommended as part of the US National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, but many challenges have precluded widespread and timely implementation of reporting. The WMAT, with technical support from the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, is the first community to establish and implement a comprehensive system which has been able to address these limitations and can serve as a model for other communities.The WMAT government passed a tribal resolution in 2001 mandating that any suicidal incident occurring on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation — including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts — should be reported to a tribal suicide surveillance system (episodes of non-suicidal self-injury and binge substance use were later added as reportable incidents).The Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health worked with the WMAT to revise the referral form, develop an in-person follow-up form, design a computerized data gathering system, and employ and train the Celebrating Life team, a local workforce of community mental health specialists. The Celebrating Life staff track, monitor and maintain the surveillance system which has received awards from the American Academy of Psychiatry, the Indian Health Service, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). In addition, the Celebrating Life staff help to analyse data and provide regular reports to the WMAT leaders on trends within the community.Over the past two decades, the community surveillance system has provided a foundation for prevention programming and evaluation. Although national rates remained stable or have increased slightly, the overall White Mountain Apache suicide death rates decreased when their suicide surveillance system and comprehensive programming were active. Suicide attempts have also decreased by 53% and the proportion of at-risk individuals seeking treatment nearly doubled from 39% to 71%.\n",

      "Under-reporting• Because of the stigma attached to suicide in many countries, many suicides and suicide attempts go unreported or are reclassified. Awareness-raising and changes to the legal status of suicide (i.e. decriminalization) are key to tackling stigma. It is important that surveillance systems maintain confidentiality and foster trust.• Under-reporting can also be a consequence of limited access to health care and restrictions on health insurance coverage, therefore limiting the number of people who seek medical support for attempted suicide. The provision of universal health coverage is vital in addressing this barrier in particular and suicide prevention overall.\n",
      "Incomplete and inaccurate data• In low-resource settings data may not be easily accessible. It will be important to draw upon other sources of information (e.g. verbal autopsy/community surveillance) and to implement a basic system for registering suicide mortality (e.g. by working with people who register deaths in the community such as the police and medical centres).• In many countries there is poor surveillance of health-care data. Advocacy for the improvement of health information systems is an important part of awareness-raising.• The registration and classification of suicidal behaviour is complex, and sufficient training, practice and ongoing monitoring is required to support data collectors. Advocacy and awareness-raising among those reporting on suicides (such as police and first responders) is important to avoid misreporting; it is key that these services are trained in detailed record-keeping and assessment of suicidal intent.• Where more than one organization is responsible for gathering suicide data, differences in practice may lead to discrepancies. It is important that representatives from different organizations are included in planning, and that common guidelines are developed to guide data collection and recording in different areas.• Where possible, national guidance on data collection should be developed to enable data from different jurisdictions to be aggregated.Lack of data and information hinders prioritization and resource allocation by decision-makers. Inadequate data collection throughout the implementation process can lead to resources being wasted on ineffective interventions.• Establish and strengthen surveillance systems for suicide and self-harm; surveillance is a core pillar of suicide prevention.• Monitor the effectiveness of primary outcomes with accurate data collection, thus enabling subsequent adjustments to be made to enhance effectiveness.• Work with interested academics to set up surveillance systems that can advise public policy.Sensitivity of data\n",
      "• Ensure that safeguards are in place to maintain confidentiality of the data (e.g. by using case identifier numbers and not using identifiable information).• Caution should be employed in the use of data, its availability and how it is communicated.

      "MONITORING AND EVALUATIONWHAT?\n",
      "Monitoring and evaluation are essential for assessing whether suicide prevention is working. Monitoring involves planned and continuous or regular measurement of information that will help to assess the progress of LIVE LIFE implementation. This should be followed by evaluation, which is a periodic review of whether LIVE LIFE has achieved its desired results. Monitoring and evaluation should be part of all interventions, and this information can be combined to evaluate the overall effectiveness of LIVE LIFE.Evaluation should consider the following:• Effectiveness. Does the intervention provide the desired outcome; did it deliver what it set out to do? Working with academics to design and interpret robust studies of effectiveness for interventions would be beneficial before implementing them widely (Kolves et al., 2021). Such studies may need to be large to provide clear and relevant evidence for policy decisions.• Implementation. Were services delivered as intended and how well were they delivered? What had a positive impact on implementation and what were the barriers/challenges? • Efficiency (cost-effectiveness). Does the intervention provide sufficient value for the costs? Are the costs sustainable/how can they be sustained in future?The principal goal of all suicide prevention activities is a reduction in rates of suicide and self-harm [see Surveillance]. However, detecting changes in suicide rates that could be attributed to prevention activities is challenging and can be assessed only in the long-term.Given these challenges, it is important that other indicators of progress are monitored and evaluated. Indicators need to have a clear and direct relationship with the principal goal. Examples may include:• enforced restriction of access to means of suicide;• more responsible reporting of suicide in the media;• more young people trained in emotional life skills;• an increased number of people utilizing and accessing support and services;• enhanced knowledge, attitudes and practice of health workers with regard to people who engage in suicidal behaviours.Measurement of progress must be planned in advance using specific, achievable, relevant and time-bound indicators (see Annex 3 for indicators for LIVE LIFE). This process should be informed by existing evidence about factors that influence suicidal behaviour in the target population. Indicators may be measured using a variety of sources (see Surveillance), including routinely collected data (e.g. CRVS, service attendance data, client demographics, referral sources) and purpose-designed data collection (e.g. interviews with stakeholders and project workers, population surveys, focus groups, research studies). \n",

      "MONITORING AND EVALUATIONWHY?\n",
      "Monitoring and evaluation are necessary to assess whether LIVE LIFE is achieving its desired result of reducing suicide and self-harm. Monitoring and evaluation can indicate whether LIVE LIFE is working in the country context, whether it provides feedback about which interventions have the largest impact, and where changes are needed. It is important that, in addition to identifying areas for improvement, evaluations consider factors that may have had a positive or negative impact on implementation (e.g. design issues, changes in funding, community engagement, economic conditions) in order to develop helpful recommendations for improvement.Reporting of evaluations ensures that information and lessons learned from the process are shared and informs other services or areas that plan to adopt similar interventions. Informing key stakeholders and the public of progress can also help to foster accountability and community support. These data can be a powerful tool to seek and secure additional resources to support ongoing efforts. \n",

      "Restricting access to lethal means of suicide is a key universal evidence-based intervention for suicide prevention. The restriction of means involves:\n",
      "• restricting access to the means (e.g. limiting, banning or regulating access to the means through national legislation and policy) by:\n",
      " »banning acutely toxic highly hazardous pesticides, as has been successful in e.g. Bangladesh, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka (Gunnell et al., 2017), and India (Bonvoisin et al., 2020); »restricting and regulating firearms, which has been successful in Australia (Chapman et al., 2006), Israel (Lubin et al., 2010), Switzerland (Reisch et al., 2013) and the United Kingdom (Haw et al., 2004); »installing barriers at potential jump sites such as bridges or rail transport locations, which has been successful in Australia at the Gateway Bridge where barriers were introduced (Law et al., 2014) and in the Republic of Korea after screens were installed at subway stations (Chung et al., 2016); »limiting access to ligatures or modifying ligature points in detention or other institutional settings (e.g. prisons, inpatient mental health); and »restricting the prescription of high-toxicity medicines, particularly those where safer alternatives exist (such as barbiturates (Oliver & Hetzel, 1972) and co-proxamol (Hawton et al., 2009).• reducing ava ilability of the means by: »limiting the quantity of individual sales for medications and other poisonous substances, such as reducing the size of medication packages and using blister packaging which makes it harder to access each medicine, as performed successfully in the United Kingdom (Hawton et al., 2001). • reducing lethality of the means (e.g. increasing availability of low-risk alternatives) by:  »introducing natural gas in households which contains less poisonous carbon monoxide compared to coal, as in the United Kingdom (Kreitman, 1976); »reducing the lethality of pesticides.• increasing availability and effectiveness of antidotes and improving clinical management following acute intoxication or injury related to commonly-used means of suicide (WHO, 2008a).Complete removal of a means of suicide will have the greatest impact, although this may encounter the greatest resistance from related stakeholders.Effective means restriction should focus on methods that:\n",

      "-----------------\n",
      "LIMIT ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF SUICIDELIVE LIFE: PART B  |  59\n",
      "Preference should be considered for means with the highest case fatality as the removal of common means that are less lethal may drive individuals towards more lethal means.Methods will vary geographically and between different sociodemographic groups (e.g. urban versus rural, age, sex) and can change over time. Surveillance is necessary to identify the means used by the population or subpopulations and any means that are newly emerging. Initially, this can be ascertained through a situational analysis (see Situation analysis).This section focuses on the example of pesticides, which are estimated to account for one fifth of all suicides globally, particularly in countries with a large proportion of rural residents and agricultural work (Mew et al., 2017). Pesticides are estimated to have prematurely killed as many as 14 million people since being introduced into poor rural communities during the Green Revolution in agriculture (Karunarathne et al., 2020). Pesticides vary significantly in their toxicity, with some being highly acutely toxic when ingested while others are much less likely to be lethal. The intervention is intended to address acutely toxic highly hazardous pesticides – i.e. those with the acutest risk to health – and not to restrict access to all pesticides used in agriculture.Key actions include banning the sale and use of acutely toxic highly hazardous pesticides whilst facilitating the use of low-risk alternatives, including organic/non-chemical pesticides; increasing research for low-risk alternatives; increased regulation of products; and encouraging proper disposal of hazardous products (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) & WHO, 2016; WHO & FAO, 2019). Measures to facilitate safe storage of pesticides such as household lockboxes and community storage facilities have not shown clear evidence of effectiveness (Pearson et al., 2017; Reifels et al., 2019).\n",
      "WHY?\n",
      "WHO advocates national bans of highly hazardous pesticides as a cost-effective intervention for reducing suicide mortality in countries where pesticides are a common means of self-harm and suicide (WHO, 2021). The estimated reduction in suicide mortality after banning highly hazardous pesticides equates to 20% progress towards the UN SDG target 3.4 (Lee et al., 2021).  .Restricting access to means not only reduces suicide related to those means, but also has been found to reduce overall suicide rates in some countries (indicating that substitution of method of suicide does not compensate for the primary reduction, as people revert to less lethal alternatives). Most people who engage in suicidal behaviour experience ambivalence about wanting to live or die, and many suicides happen impulsively as a response to acute stressors (often after much less than 30 minutes of thought). Making lethal means of suicide less easily available can provide individuals in distress with the time for acute crises to pass before fatal action is taken. A suicide attempt can be the first occasion when other people are made aware of an individual’s distress, and survival enables that person to receive support. Removing highly hazardous pesticides from agricultural practice (so that people ingest pesticides that are much less toxic) and improving the clinical management of pesticide ingestion reduces the number of people who die, regardless of their level of intent.Box 32. Ban on highly hazardous pesticides, Sri Lanka\n",
      "By 1980, Sri Lanka was known to have one of the highest suicide rates in the world, predominantly from ingestion of pesticides. The then Registrar of Pesticides recognized the problem and in 1983, in view of limited resources, placed the primary focus on prevention, banning two key pesticides for self-harm – the organophosphorus (OP) insecticides parathion and methyl parathion. Ten years later, the registrar banned all remaining highly hazardous WHO Class I pesticides, particularly monocrotophos and methamidophos, resulting in a remarkable drop in overall suicide numbers from 1995 onwards. Over the next 20 years, with another ban in 2008-2011 of paraquat and two further OP insecticides, the overall annual suicide rate fell from 57 per 100 000 people over 8 years of age in 1995 to 17 per 100 000 in 2016, a 70% reduction. The bans are estimated to have saved 93 000 lives at a direct government cost of US$ 50 per life saved (Knipe, Gunnell & Eddleston, 2017) without affecting agricultural output (Manuweera et al., 2008). Method substitution has been modest (Gunnell et al., 2007). This work benefitted from an interest in the issue by the country’s President, which was key for interagency collaboration and programme sustainability, and also active interactions between regulators, academics, agriculture extension and industry (Pearson, Anthony, & Buckley, 2010; Pearson et al., 2015). \n",

      "LIMIT ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF SUICIDEWHERE?\n",
      "A national-level response is critical for the effective regulation of means such as pesticides, particularly in countries with a high burden of suicide related to pesticides. Collaboration at a regional level may also be needed to implement regional regulations and find effective solutions for crop protection in countries with similar agriculture.\n",
      "WHEN?\n",
      "When pesticide self-poisoning is identified as one of the most common and/or most lethal methods of suicide – i.e. through situation analysis, surveillance or other country-specific research – ongoing monitoring is necessary to identify changes or trends over time – i.e. changes as to which pesticides are used and in which communities.WHO?\n",
      "Restricting access to pesticides requires multisectoral collaboration between all relevant stakeholders, including ministries of health, agriculture, regulators and registrars. Means restriction may be considered intrusive by the stakeholders of agricultural communities. Collaboration with, and endorsement by, community (agricultural) leaders is essential for increasing buy-in, awareness of the problems associated with highly toxic substances, and the availability and benefits of low-risk alternatives. The media can be an important partner in raising awareness and in using responsible reporting to limit contagion effects (see Interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide).The same principle of a multisectoral national approach applies to other means of suicide (e.g. the transport sector and the need for barriers). Communities can play a role in advocating to restrict means which have affected a local community. Box 32. Ban on highly hazardous pesticides, Sri Lanka cont. \n",

      "Community-level implementation of means restriction is also an option where this is feasible and effective (e.g. local implementation of national bans). At the individual level, family members may be asked to remove the means of suicide (e.g. pesticides, firearms, knives, medication) from a household where a person is at risk of suicide.\n",
      "HOW?\n",
      "1. Convene a working group (see Box 1, Introduction ) • Establish the group (see under Who? above).2.  Establish the most common and lethal means  in a population• Establish through surveillance, monitoring or existing research the most common and lethal means of suicide and suicide attempts in a population.• Understand if there are differences between different sociodemographic groups (e.g. between rural and urban areas).• For pesticides, ascertain which pesticides contribute to most deaths. This may be difficult from medical records and may require targeted surveys of suicide deaths or hospital-presenting cases of pesticide poisoning. Where feasible, collaboration with forensic toxicology laboratories will allow the most important pesticides to be identified for restriction.• It is important that lethal means are the focus of restriction as there is a potential danger that restricting common low-lethality methods may drive people to use higher-lethality alternatives.3.  Engage with relevant government sectors and other stakeholders related to the means of suicide• Restriction of the means will require collaboration with sectors related to the method identified under point 2 above.• In the case of pesticides this will involve the health and agricultural sectors and pesticide regulators/registrars.• Use data to advocate to the relevant sector (e.g. the number of deaths by suicide or the number of suicide attempts related to pesticides).• Be aware of the different interests of stakeholders in the pesticide industry and among users of pesticides  (WHO & FAO, 2019).• Expect to engage in advocacy over a period of time.• Ensure that the discussions are two-way: gain a better understanding of the concerns that the sector or stakeholders may have for not taking action to ban highly hazardous pesticides. Use this information to tailor advocacy efforts. For instance:  »if there is concern that changing pesticides may reduce crop yield, demonstrate the evidence that shows this is not the case and identify alternative agricultural approaches to crop protection (Gunnell et al., 2017; Manuweera et al., 2008); »bring national attention to the issue in collaboration with the media to generate advocacy efforts through public pressure.\n",
      "• For other methods of suicide consider the following stakeholders:\n",
      " »(for firearms) legislators, firearms retailers, locations or occupations where firearms are used (e.g. shooting ranges, military services, police services);\n",
      " »(for medications or poisonous substances) regulatory agencies, authorities responsible for dispensing or prescriptions, the ministry that deals with toxic fuels such as some gases. It is also important to also consider the regulation of (online) sales of such products;\n",
      " »(for jump sites such as bridges, high-rise buildings, railways, subways) transport and construction ministries and agencies; »(for ligatures/ligature points) judicial ministry, prisons and detention facilities, and institutions (such as long-term care facilities).\n",
      "4.  Agree policy or legislative action required to ban or restrict access to the means of suicide• For pesticides, this may include the following actions:\n",
      " »identification of highly hazardous pesticides for withdrawal through review of pesticides currently in circulation (FAO & WHO, 2016); »regulatory actions to ban the sale and use of acutely toxic highly hazardous pesticides, including penalties for importation of lethal pesticides and violation of pesticide regulations; »risk assessments for the registration of new products; »strengthened inspection and control of pesticide use;\n",

      "LIMIT ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF SUICIDE »supporting the use of no-pesticide agriculture and agroecology.• The acceptability of policy actions should also be considered, and steps taken to increase public support – e.g. in the case of pesticides, working with stakeholders (farmers/pesticide retailers) to increase awareness of the need for regulation and viable alternatives.5.  Agree community actions required to restrict access to means of suicide• Collaboration with local authorities will be required to monitor and enforce national regulations and policies.• For pesticides this can involve collaboration with local agricultural authorities (particularly agriculture extension services) to strengthen inspection and control, as well as working closely with farmers and pesticide retailers to provide education on the rationale for withdrawal of products and the benefits of using alternatives.• Ensure there is capacity in the health sector and guidelines for the clinical management and reporting of pesticide poisoning (WHO, 2008a).6.  Evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives (see Monitoring and evaluation)• Monitor the impact of means restriction on rates of suicide, review information gathered from inspections, and schedule regular reviews of initiatives with national and local stakeholders. In particular, identify any method substitution to methods of higher lethality or changes in the pesticides that contribute to most deaths.• Use lessons learned to inform further changes to policy and local initiatives. For instance, if inspection reveals that banned pesticides are still in use, focus groups could be convened to establish the reasons for this and to devise more effective remedies.• Evaluations can be disseminated to stakeholders to encourage further restriction of means and implementation of lessons learned.7.  Ensure that good surveillance is in place to assess changes in means and in suicide• It is important to ensure that ongoing monitoring of the methods of suicide and suicide attempts is carried out and that interventions respond to changing patterns in the means of suicide.Box 33. A story of success, Republic of Korea\n",
      "Suicide mortality in the Republic of Korea has been high compared to other high-income countries and to countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region in general. Suicides by pesticide accounted for around one fifth of all suicides in the Republic of Korea during 2006–2010. Efforts to control and minimize the harmful impact of pesticides in the country prior to 2011 had no meaningful impact as the pesticides that accounted for the majority of deaths were not adequately controlled.In 2011, the Republic of Korea enacted the Suicide Prevention Act, cancelling the re-registration of paraquat and banning its sale in 2012. These actions resulted in an immediate and clear decline in suicides by pesticide poisoning and contributed to an overall decline in suicide rates. The intervention appeared to reduce suicide rates among all population groups, including men, women, all age groups, and persons living in both urban and rural areas.More than half of the overall reduction in the suicide rate between 2011 and 2013 could be attributed to the paraquat ban. Notably, this was achieved without any impact on crop yield. Given the magnitude of suicide by pesticide self-poisoning around the world, tens of thousands of lives could be saved every year if effective regulation of pesticides were enforced worldwide. Ensuring safer access to pesticides will require an intersectoral approach, including pesticide bans and other related policies, as well as community interventions, improved health care, and training and surveillance activities. The successful approach taken by the Republic of Korea provides an encouraging model for other countries aiming to reduce suicide deaths.\n",

      "Table 11. Tips for implementation of access to the means of suicide\n",
      "Issues Tips\n",
      "Stakeholders may be reluctant to invest in means restriction due to a concern that the population will switch to another method and that people determined to die by suicide cannot be stopped• Share information with stakeholders about the evidence base: »Inform stakeholders that restriction of one method of suicide does not inevitably lead to a rise in the use of others (Yip et al., 2012). »Where substitution has been observed, individuals have often been seen to use less-toxic pesticides, resulting in lower rates of fatality and fewer total suicides (Gunnell et al., 2007). »Most people who engage in suicidal behaviour experience ambivalence about wanting to live or die. Restricting access to means can provide the time for acute crises to pass before fatal action is taken.Resistance from stakeholders due to the convenience/financial implications associated with means• Increase recognition of the problems associated with specific means through education and mitigate concerns. For example, educate stakeholders about the benefits of low-risk alternatives and advocate that the use of low-risk alternatives has no negative impact on crop yield (WHO, FAO 2019).One of the main methods of suicide involves ingestion of pesticides; however, in many contexts this remains unacknowledged and little or no action is taken• Encourage existing poison centres to share data on intentional pesticide poisoning cases in order to identify the scale of the problem.• Monitor the use of pesticides in suicide or attempted suicide in order to understand the problem; engage regulatory bodies and relevant government sectors (e.g. agriculture) in the national regulation of access to pesticides.• Build a strong awareness and advocacy campaign directed at stakeholders linked to the means of suicide.• Decriminalize suicide and suicide attempts to reduce barriers to reporting poisoning cases as suicide/suicide attempts.The most commonly used means of suicide is not easily amenable to restriction (e.g. hanging outside of closed institutional settings in the community; self-immolation)\n",
      "• Ensure continued focus of efforts to restrict access to means of suicide in institutional settings; reduce the likelihood of imitation of these means through collaboration with the media (to remove descriptions of the method when reporting on a suicide); improve capacity for clinical management of near-hanging or burns; improve help-seeking in the community (Gunnell et al., 2005); improve early identification of people at risk of suicide (see Early identify, assess, manage and follow up).Inadequate data collection can hinder attempts to identify the means of suicide on which to focus interventions• Establish or strengthen surveillance systems for suicide and self-harm which accurately record the method used and are as timely as possible. This may involve education to encourage reporting of suicides and suicide attempts.\n",

      "WHAT?\n",
      "There is evidence that media reporting of suicide can lead to a rise in suicide due to imitation, particularly in cases of celebrity suicide and where suicide methods are described (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2020). Conversely, stories demonstrating help-seeking in adverse circumstances which include information about where to seek help contribute to suicide prevention (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2014). The media (e.g. journalists, film-makers) play an important role in shaping public opinion and attitudes and are an important stakeholder in raising awareness and reducing the stigma of suicide. Working with the media can include collaboration in developing guidelines (such as recently in India; Vijayakumar, 2019) and regulating responsible coverage of suicide, which may include collaboration with the technology sector to identify articles which fail to meet reporting guidelines.\n",
      "50 Interactions will include building the capacity of media professionals to report responsibly. They may also include policies for monitoring user content on digital media platforms.\n",
      "WHY?\n",
      "Repeated glamourized coverage of high-profile suicide cases may include detailed descriptions of a suicide and fictional portrayals of suicide that do not accurately represent reality influence suicide rates (WHO, 2017). This contributes to public misunderstanding of suicide, hindering effective prevention. The increasing use of digital media means that it is becoming ever more difficult to monitor these problems, as information can be spread quickly between users. However, portrayals of suicide written in accordance with media guidelines show potential to help prevent suicide.\n",

      "The main goal of media monitoring is to reach a common understanding with the media regarding responsible reporting of suicides and suicide attempts. The Suicide Prevention Bureau reviews nearly 700 reports of suicide or suicide attempts in the online media every working day. This is achieved by using specially selected keywords and a media monitoring search engine. The title, text, video and photo material are then analysed. The analysis is based on the WHO resource booklet for media professionals (WHO, 2017) and guidance from the Lithuanian Psychologists‘ Association. If the Code of Ethics for Public Information is violated by the publication, the editor of the online media is contacted and requested to correct the publication.

      "WHERE?\n",
      "Collaboration with the media is ideally conducted with a nationally positioned media body, including media regulators. Should this not be possible, collaboration can be established with local or more specialized media outlets that may have access to specific geographical or sociodemographic groups. In the case of cross-national media, such as social or digital news media, collaboration at headquarters (international) and national levels may be required to facilitate a country-specific approach to the management of suicide-related content online. Collaboration is also needed within the stage and screen industries. \n",
      "WHEN?\n",
      "Work with the media can begin at any time. It may be triggered by harmful media coverage which requires a response. Preferably, however, collaboration should begin pre-emptively, to prevent such coverage. Building good relationships with media stakeholders, such as through actively involving them in awareness-raising, can help create a more welcoming relationship in preparation for training or policy development on responsible reporting and its monitoring. Training can be delivered at strategic times such as during the education curriculum for media professionals or at the beginning of established recruitment cycles. Opportunities for increased focus on suicide prevention can be utilized to promote collaboration, such as on World Suicide Prevention Day or World Mental Health Day.\n",
      "WHO?\n",
      "This work requires collaboration between multiple stakeholders. At the national level, leadership can come from collaboration between the Ministry of Health and ministries related to media, national media, media regulators (e.g. press ombudsman) and cross-national media organizations such as social media companies. In the community, leadership may additionally come from stakeholders with interest in suicide prevention (and who may have experience of, or links to, work with the media). NGOs can be influential in engaging with the media.

      "The dissemination and application of the guidelines on media coverage of suicide are a success story in suicide prevention, both nationally and internationally. Meanwhile, it has also been demonstrated that a certain form of reporting not only prevents imitation suicides (the “Werther effect”) but can have a general suicide-preventive effect (the “Papageno effect”). The Papageno effect refers to the character of Papageno from Mozart’s opera The magic flute. In the opera, Papageno is able to overcome his initial suicidal thoughts with the help of others. In Austria, the Austrian Press Council established suicide-preventive reporting in its code of ethics in 2012. Media articles which are not in line with responsible reporting receive admonitions by the National Press Council. In order to further disseminate the media guidelines and promote suicide prevention reporting in Austria, in 2019 the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection established – in cooperation with the Austrian Society for Suicide Prevention, the Wiener Werkstätte for Suicide Research and the Kriseninterventionszentrum – the “Papageno-Media-Prize”.\n",

Media articles are assessed for their positive thematization of suicide in line with the guidelines, as well as on journalistic criteria (e.g. quality of the writing itself). Good collaboration with the media is exemplified through the selection of the winner who is elected by a jury consisting of five journalists (nominated by the Press Council/Journalists’ Union/ Presseclub Concordia/ Association of Austrian Newspapers) and five suicide prevention experts.

The body responsible for regulation should be included as a key stakeholder.  3. Meet with media professional bodies• If it is not possible to meet with a national or regional representative body, collaborate with individual media organizations (such as one radio broadcasting company or one print newspaper which serves a local area). However, it can be helpful to first meet with multiple (local) media outlets as a group to foster a sense of collective responsibility.• Cross-national media companies such as digital social media may be included as a stakeholder alongside national media organizations. They may require a separate collaborative arrangement, depending on their legal status in your country.4.  Convey the importance of responsible reporting and discuss collaborative efforts\n",

      "The Malaysian Ministry of Health organized a national-level seminar and workshop for media professionals during the 2004 World Suicide Prevention Day in conjunction with the theme of “Media as Partners in Advocacy for Suicide Prevention”. This led to the development of the Malaysian guidelines for media reporting on suicide which were updated in 2011. However, a framing analysis of Malaysian newspapers seemed to suggest a lack of adherence to media guidelines up to 2018 (Victor et al., 2019). Consequently, responsible reporting efforts from governmental, nongovernmental and international organizations – such as public talks, media interviews, capacity-building workshops and social media interactions – have intensified over the past two years. Stakeholder engagement has been encouraging, albeit at varying levels regionally and nationally. To address this, efforts have been made to break down silos between health professionals, people with lived experience, media professionals, academics and industry regulatory bodies. Further evaluations are required to ascertain the degree of guideline implementation by the media and its impact on suicidal behaviour in Malaysia.\n",

      "Suicide is an important public health problem in Trinidad and Tobago. As part of a strategy to reduce the suicide rate in the country, the Ministry of Health of Trinidad and Tobago, together with PAHO/WHO, held an awareness-raising workshop with representatives of local news media. The workshop involved journalists, reporters, editors, radio announcers and bloggers, among others, in a national conversation on the media’s role in suicide prevention. During the workshop, experts shared evidence on the impact of responsible and irresponsible articles on suicides and shared good practices in media coverage of the issue. A senior producer said the workshop taught her that the media should not make assumptions about the cause of death: “We should provide the facts, not make speculations, not sensationalize… let people know that there are signs that indicate suicidal behaviour and help them identify those warning signs and offer advice on asking for help.”The Ministry of Health, with support from PAHO, developed guidelines with 11 best practices for responsible coverage of suicide and self- harm. The draft document underwent a series of reviews by stakeholders, including an international panel of experts, to ensure consistency with best practice and to assess the likelihood of compliance by the media. The guidelines were shared with relevant stakeholders and further feedback was obtained before they were finalized and circulated.\n",
      "To measure the impact of the guidelines, a framework for monitoring and evaluation was developed to evaluate how the media adhered to guidelines. This tool assesses compliance and identifies gaps and opportunities for further development. It rates all suicide-related news reports accessible online (deaths, attempted suicide, self-harm, suicide prevention articles etc.) on the number of guidelines violated and the number of helpful information included in the report e.g. suicide hotline, coping strategy. Media houses are then contacted on the basis of their score, are reminded of the guidelines and are informed of additional resources where required.\n",
      "A formal research study into the changes that have happened since the guidelines were circulated has not yet been done. However, there has been a noticeable change in the tenor of reporting, especially with regard to the placement of stories and omission of the more explicit details of suicide. A comprehensive review is planned to assess the qualitative and quantitative changes that have occurred since the guidelines became available. This is necessary for evaluating the guidelines.

      "Adolescence (10–19 years of age) is a critical period for the acquisition of socio-emotional skills which are the foundation for later health and well-being. However, adolescence also marks a period of risk for the onset of mental health conditions, with half of all cases occurring by the age of 14 years. The formation of socio-emotional skills associated with positive mental health is the foundation of young peoples’ development into mentally healthy adults (WHO, 2015; Sánchez Puerta et al., 2016). Increased mental health literacy may help to reduce stigma and increase knowledge of mental health (Milin et al., 2016), while helping young people notice warning signs in themselves and others can encourage help-seeking (Burns & Rapee, 2006). Given that educational settings are a main point of contact for young people in many countries, implementing suicide prevention in these settings is a viable way to reach this group.\n",

The guidelines are intended to inform a package of interventions – the HAT toolkit – which is being developed to support the operationalization of the HAT guidelines with the aim of bringing together a core set of evidence-based strategies to advance efforts to promote and protect adolescent mental health. The HAT toolkit will describe programmes that show evidence of promoting mental health in adolescents or reducing risk factors for mental illness, substance use and self-harm. The toolkit focuses on: 1) improving laws and policies; 2) improving environments within schools, communities and online to promote and protect adolescent mental health; 3) supporting carers; and 4) improving adolescents’ psychological skills. The toolkit also refers users to additional sources of information for implementation tools and experiences. A UNICEF and WHO HAT comic series for enhancing the socio-emotional learning of young adolescents in schools and an accompanying teacher’s guide will be available in 2021.\n",

      "Before commencing initiatives, care pathways which have capacity to support young people (such as child and adolescent mental health services) should be established between schools and local health and social protection services. The implementation of the training may be prompted by timing, such as delivering skills programmes in advance of periods of high stress (such as examinations). However, it is not advisable to start suicide prevention activities immediately after a suicide (although psychosocial support should be available and provided to school members).\n",
      "WHO?\n",
      "School-based suicide prevention works best where there is collaboration between multiple stakeholders. Leadership can come from collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. In the community, leadership may come from individual schools or organizations with a vested interest in suicide prevention or young people’s well-being. For optimal implementation it is important to consider the support of local politicians, schools, staff (including teachers and school counsellors/nurses), parents and caregivers, local health and protection services and/or organizations that work with young people (e.g. sports or youth groups). It is important that young people are integrated into the design of school prevention programmes. Young people are well-placed to advise on how best to engage their peers and to identify risk factors specific to their community.HOW?\n",
      "1.  Convene a working group to plan and implement school-based programmes (see Box 1, Introduction ) • Establish the group (see under Who? above).• Before implementation of the programme, ensure that schools have an adequate plan of action in place to support students and adequate links to mental health services to which they can refer students at risk. Ensure that school staff are aware of these processes and are confident and competent to carry them out.• Plan to implement the work in a selected area or select a number of schools for piloting prior to scale-up.2. Select an evidence-based intervention for young people• An expert in young people’s mental health and suicide prevention should be engaged to ensure that the selected programmes are evidence-based.• Determine which programme will fit the needs of the target population, community, or school; this will depend on the needs of the young people in addition to the resources available. If support is needed to identify an evidence-based programme, the working group is recommended to consult a research expert, an agency specializing in suicide prevention or a person familiar with this area of knowledge.• Preference should be given to previously-evaluated programmes which indicate the resources required for implementation and their strengths and limitations.• Adapt the programme for the target population as there may be cultural differences in students’ attitudes to suicide – or in how they communicate warning signs and help-seeking behaviours – compared with the original programme.• Seek advice from the developer of a programme on how best to make adaptations without reducing effectiveness, or identify other areas or schools with a similar student population who have already adapted a programme successfully. 3.  Agree a plan of action and plan for the resources required• Plan for the human resources and capacity-building required for implementation (e.g. the need to train a facilitator or school staff).• Determine who will deliver the programme (e.g. mental health providers, school welfare staff, health providers).consultation with the young people, and other suggestions on the type of language that young people would respond to were incorporated into the app. In addition, most of the local voice-over was recorded by a local Aboriginal media agency. iBobbly was developed in close coordination with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and was guided by an advisory group to inform and shape project activity associated with the implementation and quality assurance of the iBobbly app. The group ensures that iBobbly continues to meet cultural standards and is informed, shaped and directed by those for whom the app is designed – Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n",

      "Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) was a research project developed to evaluate three school-based programmes for mental health promotion and suicide prevention. The randomized controlled trial was conducted on 11 110 adolescents from 168 randomly selected schools in 10 European Union (EU) countries. The SEYLE study showed that Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) was successful in significantly improving young people’s mental health compared to the other two programmes and the control group. Compared to the control group, young people who participated in YAM showed a reduction of 50% in new suicide attempts and severe suicidal ideation (Wasserman et al., 2015) while new cases of moderate and severe depression were reduced by about 30%. The five-hour YAM programme, delivered by a specially trained instructor and a helper over three weeks, provides young people in their classroom with a safe and nonjudgemental space to explore mental health topics. The emphasis is on empathy towards others’ experiences and peer support, while empowering young people to reflect on their own mental health needs (Wasserman et al., 2018). Role-play activities are supported by an interactive talk given by an instructor , booklets on the topic given to each participant, and posters hung on the walls of the classroom that provide information that includes contacts of local health-care and youth support services.In interviews after YAM, young people have expressed feeling more confident in supporting a friend in need. They also indicate using skills and strategies acquired during the programme to help them through adverse life events. Perhaps most importantly, YAM helps young people recognize the need for support as they encounter challenges. To meet this need, information about local physical and mental health care options as well as youth-serving organizations in their communities is shared with them.The YAM programme is a novel, effective and cost-effective (Ahern et al., 2018) school-based intervention in suicide prevention that improves coping skills, increases empathy, help-seeking behaviour and peer help, and encourages a positive classroom climate. The YAM programme has been taken up by countries around the world. The Mental Health in Mind International, a research and development enterprise created with support from Karolinska Institutet Innovations, is implementing the results from the SEYLE project. Current implementation and evaluation programmes are taking place in Europe (Austria, France, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom) Australia, India and the USA. To date, more than 100 000 students worldwide have participated in the YAM programme.\n",

      "Resistance from staff• It is essential to secure the well-being of staff prior to initiating student programmes so that they are well-placed to support those at risk. This will involve providing a safe school environment where staff are encouraged to access support, and where they have adequate training to increase their confidence in communicating with distressed students and managing risk.• It is also important to ensure good cross-sector collaboration for students who require services/support outside the school setting.Lack of time and resources for planning and implementation, or it is not seen as a priority compared to traditional academic classes• Prevention programmes can be integrated into existing school initiatives (e.g. health classes or other health programmes) or peer leadership programmes.• Existing events in the school calendar can provide a good opportunity to launch prevention programmes, such as healthy school weeks and mental health awareness days/weeks.\n",

      "WHAT?\n",
      "Early identification, assessment, management and follow-up ensure that people who are at risk of suicide, or who have attempted suicide, receive the support and care that they need. Health systems need to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component in order to intervene early when people are identified as being at risk of suicide. Health-care workers should be trained in early identification, assessment, management and follow-up (WHO, 2019b). Non-health actors who come in contact with at-risk individuals (e.g. in the community) should be competent in early identification and follow-up. Health-care systems should coordinate care pathways for the referral of individuals to follow-up support in the community or specialist mental health care. At-risk individuals may experience risk factors and care needs that cannot be addressed by the health sector alone. For example, a person may require support in accessing employment or financial opportunities in addition to support from the health system. Likewise, in the example of Japan, people presenting to the social welfare department with financial difficulties are automatically referred to the health sector for simultaneous care.Postvention support\n",
      "58 should be available for people who have attempted suicide and those who have been bereaved by suicide. In addition to support provided by health services, community-led follow-up can pertain to survivors’ groups of people bereaved by suicide (WHO, 2008b), self-help groups facilitated by persons with lived experience, or volunteer services.59 Crisis services such as crisis community treatment teams or crisis lines should also be available to provide immediate support to individuals in acute distress (WHO, 2018c).\n",

The emergency department-based post-suicide attempt case management started with 25 locations in 2013, had been expanded to 85 locations in 2020 and will continue its expansion. Case managers, who contact patients within 24 hours of their presentation to the emergency department with a suicide attempt, have weekly meetings to discuss all active cases.

      "Health systems are currently failing to meet the mental health needs of their populations, and the scarcity and unequal distribution of services means that many people do not receive the care they need (WHO, 2018b). It is essential to aim for universal health coverage\n",
      "60 to ensure that all people are able to access quality care.\n",
      "61 Implementing mental health service recommendations – including providing 24-hour crisis care, local policies for patients with dual diagnoses, and providing multidisciplinary reviews after a suicide – was associated with reduced suicide rates in clinical populations over time in England and Wales (While et al., 2012). There is also scope to provide management and follow-up digitally.As people experiencing physical and mental health conditions are at increased risk of suicide (WHO, 2018b; WHO, 2019b) and may already be in contact with health services, health-care workers are well-placed to identify people at risk. Therefore, health workers should be trained to identify, assess, manage and follow up people at risk of suicide and should feel confident to do so. Following contact with health services, people can feel isolated and are at substantially increased risk of further suicide attempts. Consequently, prompt and systematic follow-up care is essential as this has been shown to reduce suicides and suicide attempts following discharge (Goldman-Mellor et al., 2019; Fontanella et al., 2020). Families and friends affected by suicide can also be at risk and may experience feelings of guilt, shame and stigmatization which make it difficult to access social support. Proactive follow-up should be provided to this group.\n",
      "WHERE?\n",
      "Initiatives to promote early identification, assessment, management and follow-up should be coordinated at the national level but adapted to meet the needs of local communities. Implementation should be piloted in a single health service or in district health services prior to scale-up. Activities should be conducted across all levels of health care – particularly primary care services which may be the principal source of (mental) health care in many countries, and emergency units where persons may present after a suicide attempt (which is an important risk factor for suicide).\n",
      "WHEN?\n",
      "Before commencing activities that may identify people at risk (such as training health workers), care pathways for management and follow-up should already be established. The training of health workers or actors in the community should be strategically timed (see Capacity-building).\n",
      "WHO?\n",
      "The Ministry of Health should lead the work with local health services – i.e. activities may target specific health departments or units likely to come into contact with at-risk individuals such as those dealing with emergencies, mental health, alcohol use disorders, chronic pain or chronic diseases.

      "South Australia established Australia’s first Aboriginal-specific Aftercare model delivered by and co-designed with the local Aboriginal community. In 2017 Country South Australia Primary Health Network (CSA PHN) worked with the Black Dog Institute on a series of indigenous community forums. Consultations indicated that people were keen for follow-up services for people leaving hospital after a suicide crisis, identifying this as a gap in local services. An Aboriginal working group was established in collaboration with the local community, including people with lived experience and representatives from the local health network and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (ACCHO). The group spent eight months documenting the co-design process and developing a model, followed by four months of stakeholder consultation.CSA PHN commissioned the Pika Wiya Health Service Aboriginal Corporation to deliver the Aboriginal Aftercare Service in Port Augusta. Pika Wiya Health Service Corporation recruited an aftercare team comprising the clinical team leader, who is a social worker, and two Aboriginal health workers. The aftercare team sits within the social and emotional well-being team (SEWB) and has internal supports from a psychologist and visiting psychiatrist.The project has produced two sets of guidelines – for use in the emergency department and for the community mental health team. These are the Aboriginal Aftercare Service Design and the Guidelines for Integrated Suicide-Related Crisis and Follow-Up Care. Each offers a comprehensive staged approach to maintaining contact through admission and after discharge with a mix of psychosocial, clinical and healing approaches with a strong focus on family and community.An unanticipated positive outcome has been greater collaboration between clinical and cultural workers across the spectrum of mental health services. Mental health plans and referrals overseen by the visiting psychiatrist now frequently include a recommendation for healing alongside other supports. Aftercare workers have been invited to participate in traditional healing with ngangkari (defined as an Indigenous practitioner of bush medicine). Hospital mental health staf f are similarly reported to be more comfortable referring people post-discharge to social and emotional well-being services and general practitioner services knowing that these services can draw on the expertise of the aftercare team. Ongoing clinical management, including medication support, is now with the Pika Wiya Health Service and not the hospital, thus continuing to build capacity within the health service.The Aftercare Service is also working with established postvention services that include the National Indigenous Critical Response Service and Beyond Blue’s service, The Way Back.\n",

      "The integration of mental health services into primary health care in the Islamic Republic of Iran is considered one of the major turning points in scaling up public mental health services, including the suicide prevention programme. Enhanced access to mental health care services, and early recognition of depression and other mental health conditions (which are associated with suicide) are mainly sought by delivering primary mental health care by general practitioners (GPs), multipurpose general health-care workers and clinical psychologists in the primary health care field in both rural and urban areas countrywide. Multipurpose general health-care workers perform initial screening for any mental health problems according to the client’ s age group and in parallel with the assessment in other health fields. If the screening result is positive, the client is assessed for suicidal ideation or history of suicide attempt and, if detected to have any suicide risk, will be referred to the GP for further assessment.According to the GP risk assessment and clinical judgement, patients are referred to the nearest hospital if they are considered high-risk. A previously-prepared workflow guides the GP when dealing with cases who are uncooperative. For low-risk individuals, management is initiated by the GP in accordance with the Mental Health Guide for management of mental disorders in primary health care. If a specialist consultation is needed at any stage, the patient is referred to the local psychiatrist.All suicidal patients are introduced to clinical psychologists who work in urban health centres. The patients receive concurrent telephone follow-up, psychoeducation and/or brief psychological interventions along with other treatment modules if they have been referred to the hospital or the psychiatrist. At another level, patients admitted to hospital after suicide attempts are also referred to health centres upon discharge to be placed in this cycle.Follow-up service packages to support of survivors (bereaved by suicide) have also been developed and clinical psychologists will be trained to deliver this postvention service. Capacity-building for providing these services is based on obligatory pre-service training and in-service booster training sessions for all service providers. The National Suicide Prevention Programme of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education has six strategic objectives. The programme has been operating officially since 2005 and was scaled up in 2018 after feedback from national and international consultants.\n",

      "A major challenge hampering suicide prevention efforts in Australia has been a lack of detail about the scale and extent of the issue. In collaboration with the Australian National University and SAS (a software company), the Black Dog Institute continues to develop the data analytics and insights system to gain insights and help local communities develop more targeted and evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives. The system is currently being deployed as part of Black Dog Institute’s LifeSpan trials.Components of the system include the following: Suicide Data Analytical Reports (SDARs)Local-area audits are used to monitor trends, identify high-risk groups vulnerable to suicide, and inform the development and implementation of local strategies to minimize risk. These reports deliver regionally-specific information in a way that has meaningful implications for translating findings into practical outcomes.Geospatial analysisThe audits and the intelligence system can visualize data sources and show the importance of spatial resolution. V isualizing data geospatially helps to depict where concentrations of suicide deaths are occurring in local areas. This analysis allows decision-makers to better consider factors such as social and economic advantage and disadvantage, availability of services and specific hotspot locations.Means restrictionMeans restriction is one of the most effective strategies for reducing suicide. The system helps determine if there are patterns for methods and their availability, and variations in the geospatial distribution that could help inform a targeted means restriction strategy for a region and determine specific means restriction activities and interventions based on local need.Resource atlasThe LifeSpan resource atlas is an online interactive resource that researchers and policy-makers can use to create maps and analyses. The atlas helps answer questions about, and improve coordination of, suicide prevention. It allows users to discover community characteristics and share information.A team of eight data officers, geographers and postdoctoral fellows were responsible for designing and setting up the data platform, applying for data acquisition from primary data custodians, and drawing up data management procedures. Maintaining operation of the system and producing the outputs specified above requires a minimum of two full-time data officers, a data manager and the equivalent of one full-time geographer.Currently, the system is set up to provide highly specific information for New South Wales (one of the major states in Australia). However, it also provides data on suicide deaths at national level. A major end-goal is to scale up the self-harm data to national level. However, meeting this goal will require substantially more resources (a minimum of three additional data officers and one geographer) to have appropriate capacity to navigate ethics requirements for data acquisition and use and to undertake the complex data management needed to ingest multiple sources of data into the system in a harmonized manner .SITUATION ANAL YSISANNEX 2.

      "The Mental Health Office at the Iraqi Ministry of Health initiated a national study of suicide from 2015 to 2016 in collaboration with international researchers (Abbas et al., 2018). The Ministry of the Interior facilitated the distribution of a data collection forms to police stations in the 13 provinces covered by the study. Police personnel completed the forms in relation to individual deaths in their jurisdiction which had been ruled as suicide from 2015 to 2016, and followed up with families where data were missing data from the legal notes. The data collection form included variables on demographics, method of the suicide, medical, mental health and suicide attempt history, and potential causes. The results were used to identify the population and subpopulation suicide rate (e.g. age and gender), common methods of suicide, and the profile of medical, mental health, suicide and precipitating factors related to deaths by suicide. Comparisons were also conducted between different demographic groups to identify at-risk groups. Lessons learned from implementation of the first national study have informed planning for the development of a national register of suicide in Iraq. This includes improvement of data quality – which in this study relied on legal reports and family which may have contributed to under-recognition or under-reporting – and the inclusion of additional expertise to inform design and data collection (e.g. epidemiologist and forensic medicine specialist). The study also indicated the need to implement means restriction for firearms and kerosene (related to self-immolation) in future suicide prevention efforts in Iraq.\n",

      "ANNEX 2: CASE STUDIESBox 46. Situation analysis, Syrian Arab Republic\n",
      "The impact of the protracted emergency on the lives of people living in North West (NW) Syria, including the impact of COVID-19, has led to several areas of concern for suicide prevention. The months of April–June 2020 saw a 57.7% increase in attempted suicide compared to January–March 2020, as indicated by mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) service mapping. Within a similar period, social media reports from journalists claimed an increase in the number of deaths by suicide. However, mortality data were not recorded in the existing health information systems, reflecting a significant challenge for the surveillance of suicide and self-harm in NW Syria.WHO’s Gaziantep hub, with the support of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s thematic working group on MHPSS, saw an urgent need to address suicidal behaviour inside NW Syria. The thematic working group set up a Suicide Prevention Ad Hoc Task Force with six members who agreed that a situation analysis was required in order to inform planning and provide evidence that would facilitate donor requests. This was the start of a “suicide questionnaire” which was developed by the working group. The aim of the survey was to better understand suicide inside NW Syria over the previous 12 months and therefore identify actions for suicide prevention in NW Syria as of the fourth quarter of 2020. The questionnaire included 36 questions which were related to health workers’ experiences with people who had died by suicide or attempted suicide/self-harm in the previous six months. It included questions about the providers’ capacity and skills for working in suicide prevention. Questions from the Assessing mental health and psychosocial needs and resources toolkit were also translated and adapted to the NW Syrian context (WHO & UNHCR, 2012). For logistical reasons, a digital survey methodology was agreed as the most feasible method of collecting the necessary data. KoBo Toolbox\n",
      "63 – a free open-source tool for digital data collection – was used. The toolbox provides users with features such as graph-generation, making it ideal for use in humanitarian contexts. In September 2020, invitations to take the survey were offered to physicians in both primary health care and hospitals, MHPSS staff (psychosocial support workers, psychiatrists and psychologists), gender-based violence and child protection staff and paramedic workers in NW Syria a total of 534 respondents (including 206 females). For six months during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1748 attempted suicides and 246 deaths by suicide were reported by respondents. Of those who died by suicide, 76% were Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), as were 86.6% of those who attempted suicide. Of those who attempted suicide, 42.2% were 21–30 years of age, 25% were aged 31–40 years and 18.1% were 16–20 years of age. Among the methods of suicide reported, 21.4% ingested insecticides at home, 16% used a knife and 11.5% jumped from buildings. The precipitating factors for suicide were thought to be: relationship/marriage problems (26.3%), financial problems (23.7%), relationship problems with parents (12.7%) and unemployment (10.4%). The survey results also indicated barriers to discussing suicide in the health sector, barriers in the community – specifically stakeholders with the largest concern for discussing suicide (such as religious leaders) – and assessed respondents’ limited current knowledge and requests for capacity-building. A series of key recommendations were produced following analysis of the survey which will be the focal area of work for suicide prevention in NW Syria.\n",

      "Box 47. An example of bottom-up multisectoral collaboration, Brazil\n",
      "A mid-sized town (population 140 000) in the countryside of São Paulo State has in the last 10 years had a suicide rate that was twice the national rate. In March 2016, following an open invitation in the local media by a local social worker , about 100 people met at the local office of the Industry Federation. Those people came from diverse origins: health-care workers, educators, religious leaders, housewives, police officers and firemen, politicians and politicians-to-be, media professionals, hotline operators, justice officers, local celebrities and others. This town was and is exceptionally gifted with mental health resources – both public (a university hospital with a psychiatric ward, a psychiatric hospital, a hospital specialized in the care of people with substance use disorders, several outpatient services and day-centres) and private (the third largest proportion of psychiatrists per population in the country and several therapeutic communities for people with substance use disorders). However, the public services were administratively and financially dependent on a variety of federal, state and municipal agencies, with limited coordination between them. The stakeholders’ meeting decided to put in place a Life Protection Network (LPN) using their own resources and acting as volunteers. A four-person Coordinating Committee was elected by those present and eight working groups were established, namely: 1) supporters (composed of people without a professional mental health background but actively engaged in social media, usually housewives, commerce employees and students); 2) spiritual supporters (religious leaders); 3) assessment (health workers, mostly psychologists); 4) mental health professionals (psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists); 5) educators (teachers, school principals; 6) local authorities (city mayor, city councilors, relevant county secretaries [Health Education, Social Welfare, Culture, Sport and Public Safety], directors of mental health services); 7) local media; and 8) ambassadors (young people specially trained by the LPN).An important requirement for becoming a volunteer member of the LPN is to undergo a four-hour training by the coordinators using the self-harm/suicide module of the WHO mhGAP Intervention Guide. Given the wide support from volunteers, the LPN now has a waiting list of professional and caregiver volunteers. There are also regular monthly supervision meetings open to all volunteers to discuss issues of their interest, particularly in dealing with more complex cases. The network started to be operational two weeks after the initial meeting and soon after the training sessions for all specific volunteer groups.People can contact the LPN via the site www.precisodeajuda.org (“I need help”, in Portuguese) either for themselves or for someone they identified who is in distress. Primary health care workers and emergency care services can also contact the LPN. Several activities have been developed by the LPN volunteers: some are of a supportive nature (social and spiritual support), psychological enhancement (life skills training) or clinical care (integrative community therapy, complementary therapies recommended by the Ministry of Health, psychotherapy, follow-up and referral, and postvention), and some are related to universal promotion and prevention (such as awareness-raising at community level). All members of the LPN act as volunteers and occasional costs (room meeting rental, printed materials etc.) are covered by the local commerce and industries.Although the specific impact of the LPN is awaiting measurement, one clear result is that the previous lack of coordination among the several types of health-care services has been overcome. Through the LPN, early identification and care are now promptly provided by competent and trained people, with a smooth and rapid transition between different levels of care when needed.\n",

      "The privatization and deregulation of the alcohol market in the Russian Federation in the 1990s may have contributed to the escalation of alcohol-related problems, with alcohol consumption contributing substantially to increased morbidity and mortality levels.\n",
      "64 In 2004, the government began a process of strengthening alcohol-control policies (Levintova, 2007), followed by a series of amendments to the law governing regulation of the production and trading volume of alcohol products. This was then followed by amendments to other laws and regulations related to alcohol. Between 2007 and 2016, total (recorded and unrecorded) alcohol consumption was reduced by 3.5 litres of pure alcohol per capita. During the period 2005–2015, the death rate from alcohol use also declined, especially in males. Similar patterns were observed among patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence and other alcohol-related diseases, along with an important reduction in total adult mortality – all of which are likely to be a result of the downward trends in general alcohol consumption. Many of the policies implemented have been evidence-based in line with the WHO Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol (WHO, 2010) and were introduced in a stepwise manner. It is therefore likely that restrictive alcohol policies have contributed to the reduction of suicide seen in the Russian Federation.Box 48. Multisectoral collaboration, Canada\n",
      "Federal Coordinating CommitteeThe Government of Canada supports collaborative approaches to suicide prevention in order to improve information-sharing and facilitate opportunities for partnership. In late 2016, the government released the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention, which establishes strategic objectives and guiding principles to align federal suicide prevention efforts. To help improve collaboration between federal government departments, the Public Health Agency of Canada chairs the Federal Coordinating Committee for Suicide Prevention, which meets quarterly. This Committee comprises representatives from federal departments and agencies working in the area of mental health and suicide prevention, including representatives from ministries and agencies of health, Indigenous services, economic development, transport and statistics. The Committee meets quarterly and is focused on identifying suicide prevention priorities and developments across the federal government, aligning efforts where possible; sharing information and expertise on suicide prevention, including on suicide-related surveillance; and supporting the development of the biennial progress reports.National collaborative for suicide preventionThe National Collaborative for Suicide Prevention is a pan-Canadian collective of individuals (e.g. survivors of suicide attempt and survivors of suicide loss) and organizations that provide leadership, resources and information-sharing for suicide prevention, intervention and postvention initiatives. Formed in June 2012, the members of the Collaborative promote mental health, build resiliency, foster hope, and work to reduce the impact of suicide on all Canadians. The work of the Collaborative is structured and championed with the support of an Executive Committee, three working groups (the Communications Working Group, the National Strategy Action Plan Working Group and the Data and Research Working Group) and a Secretariat. The purpose of the Collaborative is: to facilitate discussions and knowledge exchange between organizations on life promotion, mental wellness and suicide prevention; to act as a catalyst for collaboration between members; and to advocate and provide a forum for a collective voice on issues related to suicide prevention.\n",

      "The Lived Experience Panel (LEP), established in September 2019 by Scotland’s National Suicide Prevention Leadership Group (NSPLG), supports delivery of the Scotland’s Suicide Prevention Action Plan.\n",
      "65 The LEP comprises 14 people from diverse professional and social backgrounds who responded to a national advertisement and who give their time as committed volunteers. Each panel member has a different connection to suicide: some are survivors of bereavement from suicide, others have been suicidal in the past or have been carers of family members or friends living with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. They are supported with respect and sensitivity by a coordinator hosted by the Scottish Association of Mental Health. A wider network of over 100 people across the country with lived experience of the impacts of suicide is also involved in supporting the work of the NSPLG through a range of activities.\n",
      "Based on the learning from the establishment of the LEP and its collaborative partnership with the NSPLG, 13 key ingredients have been identified that have proved essential to achieving meaningful and authentic participation of those with lived experience of suicide in the delivery of Scotland’s Suicide Prevention Action Plan: • Recruitment of volunteers – There are fixed criteria for volunteering (suggested gap of two years since prior suicide attempt or bereavement by suicide). This enables safer participation and reduces potential distress.• Recruitment of a designated Lived Experience Coordinato r – To manage volunteers, liaise with stakeholders and implement safeguarding protocols.• Steering Group – Establish a partnership Steering Group to support the coordinator role and to use learning to update policy and processes.• Agree outcomes and set expectations – Ensure that volunteers are aware of programme outcomes and that activities are aligned to these; manage volunteer expectations.• Methods of engagement and deliberatio n – Promoting respectful and honest conversations helps to nurture openness between volunteers and build trusting relationships. Non-polemical methods of sharing lived experiences helps volunteers to prioritize key issues and identify areas for improvement.• Engagement planning and preparation – Professionals and volunteer coordinators should agree session plans and share information with volunteers in advance of each session.• Gathering feedback – Deploy a range of ways to gather feedback (written, audio, focus groups, digital) to maximize opportunities for participation. Smaller groups have proved to be the most effective and safest way for volunteers to share personal stories.\n",
      "• Virtuous feedback cycle – Agreeing feedback mechanisms with volunteers avoids tokenistic participation. It ensures that those taking action produce evidence of using knowledge while also assuring volunteers that their views are being taken seriously.\n",
      " »Hold follow-up meetings with volunteers about progress. »Agree timescales for feedback. »Incorporate views into reports. »Ensure that volunteers attend programme meetings.• Seeking permission at every turn – Volunteers must be consulted at every turn on sharing personal information. They have the final say on information-sharing; checking for consent should be ongoing.• Emotional support and safeguarding – Welfare check-ins with volunteers must routinely take place before, during and after engagement sessions.• Volunteer agreement and handbook – There should be clearly recorded responsibilities and boundaries for volunteers, including a list of crisis support services.• Debriefing after sharing lived experiences – Open channels are essential: the impact of sharing can be cathartic but also may trigger painful memories and difficult emotions.• Self-care – This is not an optional extra. Well-being sessions are vital.\n",

      "Roses in the Ocean is an organization for lived experience (LE) of suicide founded in 2008 and fully staf fed by people with an LE of suicide. The organization was established at a time when suicide was barely spoken about in Australian communities and it was apparent that the government and services needed to hear from people who had walked in the shoes of suicide. It has grown to become a driving force behind significant reform in suicide prevention in Australia where genuine integration of lived experience expertise is now deemed central to all suicide prevention initiatives.Roses in the Ocean defines the lived experience of suicide as having experienced suicidal thoughts, made a suicide attempt, cared for someone through suicide crisis, or been bereaved by suicide.The work of Roses in the Ocean began by raising community awareness through lived experience story-telling at community and corporate events, but it was soon realized that its role needed to be far more than a speaker ’s bureau. The organization soon developed a suite of capacity-building workshops for people with an LE of suicide to build their skills and knowledge in order to engage in suicide prevention at their local community and at national level in a variety of ways.The need to work at both grassroots level in the community building an LE workforce and at strategic level with the suicide prevention sector and government was critical to actively inform, influence and enhance all aspects of suicide prevention from service design and delivery, to research, to policy etc.No funding was forthcoming for the first eight years, so Roses in the Ocean relied on the generosity of volunteers, some of them full-time, to make progress. Some key people in suicide prevention began to listen and lent their credibility to open the right doors in government and to help the organization grow. As the organization was a registered charity with a board of directors, it provided the government with a vehicle through which – tentatively at first and then much more deliberately – to support the voice of lived experience.In 2018, the Australian Government provided core funding for Roses in the Ocean through the National Suicide Prevention Leadership and Support Program. The rest of Roses in the Ocean’s income is generated through fee-for-service work and specific project funding from various Primary Health Networks, State and Territory Health Departments, and sector organizations.Today, Roses in the Ocean is involved in a wide range of activities, such as the delivery of capacity-building workshops for people with LE of suicide, national LE mentoring services, integration of people with LE of suicide into organizations, communities of practice, building capacity through training local persons with LE to deliver LE-informed “lifekeeper” training, co-designing nonclinical safe spaces, developing the emerging specialist Suicide Prevention Peer Workforce, and working with research institutes and researchers to integrate LE into research and to guide new research focus.Steps to establish an LE workforce are:• Build on what has already been learned and developed around the world.• Support and fund the establishment of an LE organization that will: »engage people with LE of suicide who are keen to inform and influence suicide prevention; »invest in building LE capacity to share people’s stories and insights and meaningfully participate in local and national suicide prevention conversations and work; »grow an LE network with varied LE perspectives and skills; »work to embed an LE framework across organizations and government with LE representation at all levels of governance;  »identify specific local and national areas of key focus.\n",

      "The President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS),66 established a three-year action plan to address suicide in the USA, with a focus on veteran populations. PREVENTS was created with the full support of the White House as well as senior leadership from every US federal agency. To lead the effort, a seasoned mental health expert from the nongovernmental sector with 15 years of experience creating and coordinating large multisectoral coalitions was chosen as Executive Director. PREVENTS has been able to leverage the convening power of the White House to ensure that government – as well as nongovernmental leaders – participated fully in the building and implementation process. In addition, the Executive Director brought organizations and partnerships to the initiative who were committed to adding their resources and expertise to the effort. This combination of significant political support, adequate resources provided by government and nongovernmental partners, and strong and effective leadership to drive the initiative has been key to the success of PREVENTS.Over 150 subject matter experts from 15 federal agencies collaborated in a year-long process to develop the PREVENTS roadmap. This created a plan for suicide prevention grounded in public health with goals of culture change, seamless access to care, a connected research ecosystem and robust community engagement. This action plan emphasizes an all-of-Nation, whole-of-government approach that will continue to leverage a network of partners and champions consisting of more than 1000 individuals, including national PREVENTS ambassadors, and organizations representing federal/state/local/tribal government, faith-based communities, nonprofits, academia, veteran and military service organizations, and other private industry partners working collaboratively to implement best practices to improve health and prevent suicide. Implementation of the PREVENTS roadmap began a multi-year process that includes a significant focus on programme evaluation to measure efficacy and impact of each strategic area as well as the overall approach. PREVENTS has created a comprehensive model to enlist all Americans to work together to:• change the conversation about mental health and advance the understanding of the underlying risk and protective factors associated with suicide through a robust public health campaign (The REACH\n",
      "67 public health campaign was launched in 2020, providing people with the tools and resources to REACH out for help when they are suffering and to REACH to help others who are struggling);• design and support effective programmes to provide veterans with the services they need;• build a research ecosystem that encourages data-sharing and coordination; and• working across federal agencies, foster a culture and develop initiatives that support a person’ s ability to thrive throughout the entire life cycle.PREVENTS has elevated the national conversation around mental health and suicide by: 1) adopting a national public health approach aimed at educating all Americans about the importance of mental health and suicide prevention; 2) developing a robust coalition of partners inside and outside of government; and 3) facilitating collaboration and coordination for this first of its kind all-of-nation effort to prevent suicide.\n",

      "68 In the Gaza Strip, data also show that suicide rates continue to increase, especially among young people and adolescents.\n",
      "69 However, data on suicide and attempted suicide in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem are scarce, with most cases being covered up, condoned, undocumented or simply undiscovered. Many factors contribute to the lack of studies and registers on suicide in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, including social stigma, religious misconceptions (haram/sin), and the lack of capacity and coordination between major actors on the ground. From this context, efforts were joined in 2017 to establish the National Committee of Suicide Prevention in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem. The committee, led by the Ministry of Health with technical support from WHO, proposed the first National Suicide Prevention Strategy for 2021-2026. The strategy signals the commitment of committee members and key stakeholders in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem (government actors, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), WHO, national NGOs, and the international NGO Médecins du Monde (MdM-CH) to address the issue of suicide in the occupied Palestinian territory , including east Jerusalem. The committee has also worked on increasing data collection, has set-up an action plan for different sectors, and has encouraged stakeholders to allocate funds for planning implementation. Nonetheless, efforts have been stalled by the many challenges imposed, including: the limited number of mental health professionals: the gap in service provision, detection and prevention between key providers (health, education and protection); the scarcity of accurate data; and the presence of stigma. As a result, different members of the committee have worked to raise awareness of the topic through national multimedia campaigns and have worked with media on responsible reporting. Additionally, MdM-CH conducted a 2019 study on the risk factors of attempted suicide in the West Bank.\n",

      "The Australian Government has outlined a range of suicide prevention policy reforms that combine strong national leadership with systematic regional efforts that recognize local differences. Key among these is the National Suicide Prevention Trial (NSPT), a major initiative that involves 11 Primary Health Networks (PHNs) taking a systems-based approach to commissioning enhanced services for people at risk of suicide. The Australian Government established PHNs to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services, reduce fragmentation of care and improve health outcomes for everyone, especially the most vulnerable.North Western Melbourne Primary Health Network (NWMPHN) is the only PHN in Victoria taking part in the NSPT. NWMPHN is the biggest of Victoria’s six primary health networks with a catchment of about 1.6 million people covering highly diverse communities from Melbourne’s Central Business District and inner city to the rapidly growing suburbs in the north and west Department of Health Primary Health Network locator.The vulnerable population that is the focus of NWMPHN NSPT is the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) communities. LGBTIQ Australians have significantly poorer mental health outcomes and suicidality and a large proportion of LGBTIQ Australians reside in the North Western Melbourne area. Activities within the NSPT are led by the LGBTIQ taskforce, which consists of representatives from LGBTIQ organizations and advocacy bodies, representatives from the broader LGBTIQ community, and those with a voice of lived experience. The taskforce identified a need for education and training to build the capacity of the LGBTIQ specialist services sector and others working with the LGBTIQ community in order to develop skills to identify the warning signs of poorer mental health and suicide for LGBTIQ people. LivingWorks Australia has begun work with representatives from the taskforce and LGBTIQ community to adapt existing evidence-based methods of suicide prevention and intervention (ASIST and safeTALK). All LivingWorks programmes have gone through extensive design and development and are regularly updated to reflect the latest evidence and best practice knowledge about suicide prevention. The training programmes were adapted through an extensive co-design process with LGBTIQ stakeholders, with an aim to make the workshops feel safe and inclusive and to build capacity of the LGBTIQ and the broader mainstream sectors to respond to LGBTIQ community members who need suicide intervention support.As at the end of 2020, a total of 206 people had been trained in LGBTIQ ASIST & safeTalk, including 33 LGBTIQ community leaders, with 10 ASIST trainers and seven safeTALK trainers through a train-the-trainer model. A number of these trainers are now registered ASIST and safeTALK trainers, who will continue to deliver adapted training and support the sustainability of the project post the end of the trial in June 2021.In addition, the Essential understanding guide for delivering LivingWorks education training to LGBTIQ populations  has been developed with the LGBTIQ community. This is designed to complement the ASIST trainer manual and acts as a guide for trainers delivering the LGBTIQ version of ASIST, as well as providing guidance for existing trainers on how to ensure that their training is always safe and inclusive for participants within the LGBTIQ community.Impacts of the project include:• creating inclusive and safe training workshops for LGBTIQ communities, by LGBTIQ communities; and• strengthening the capacity of LGBTIQ organizations to become suicide-safer communities. One workshop participant said that:“Having all queer people in the workshop made it feel very safe and was one of the best parts of the training.”\n",

      "The Community Gatekeeper Suicide Prevention Training Project in British Columbia was created to develop a formally-trained network of people who could identify and support persons who are exhibiting signs of distress or suicide risk and connect them with available services. The 9466 individual gatekeepers involved in the project were identified on the basis of their frequent direct contact with members of their community, being in a position of responsibility and trust, being aware of community resources, and being comfortable with encouraging help-seeking in others. These gatekeepers received LivingWorks’ safeTALK or ASIST training and the project added over 40 trainers to the province’s overall training capacity. This project began in 2015 with a one-time investment of 3 million Canadian dollars from the British Columbia Ministry of Health to the British Columbia division of the Canadian Mental Health Association. Although the work concluded in 2018, future work that builds on the successes of the gatekeeper training project will be supported by a sustainability fund that was generated through workshop fees.Box 58.

      "In line with the Manual on Community Based Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergencies and Displacement  of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the IOM Iraq Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) programme has included suicide prevention and response as one of the strategic activities in its Community Stabilization portfolio after ascertaining the priority of this topic in the involved communities.In 2019, IOM Iraq organized focus group discussions in different camp and out-of-camp settings to understand the community perceptions and risk factors associated with suicide among displaced persons. IOM identified that the lack of information about risk and protective factors and the lack of awareness of possible community support are key challenges that contribute to the stigma around suicide and the lack of adequate response. IOM’s MHPSS team developed an awareness-raising package that addressed different audiences such as health-care workers, people working in schools, families who had lost someone to suicide. A leaflet outlining common misconceptions about suicide targeted the general public. The leaflets were made available in English, Arabic, Sorani and Bahdini Kurdish. The electronic versions were circulated with all members of the MHPSS Technical Working Group in Iraq and IOM has donated thousands of copies to the Ministries of Health in Baghdad and Erbil in addition to many local and international NGOs that requested printed copies.IOM Iraq’s MHPSS team recognized the lack of trained human resources who could engage the community to raise awareness on a topic that they consider to be very sensitive. Between 2019 and 2020, IOM organized a series of training-of-trainers courses to provide participants (e.g. health-care workers, people working in schools, families who lost someone to suicide) with the knowledge and skills needed to raise the community’s awareness about suicide and overcome the barriers of stigma and sensitivity around the topic. Some 200 people from 10 governorates in dif ferent parts of Iraq were trained to communicate to their communities the risk factors, protective factors, possible ways to prevent suicide, and how to provide brief support to individuals and families at the community level until professional help is available. IOM supported some of the participants in organizing community awareness-raising sessions in camps for internally displaced persons, informal settlements and villages. These sessions were a chance for “on the job” supervision and coaching to ensure the effectiveness of the training. It was also a good opportunity to pilot the awareness-raising materials and make them more user-friendly.\n",

      "National suicide prevention work in Turkey was restructured in line with the National Mental Health Action Plan (2011-2023). In 2019, all provinces in Turkey were asked to identify a focal point to lead suicide prevention work. These professionals were trained by the Ministry of Health on the development of local plans for the prevention of suicide in their provinces, as well as post-intervention referrals and the importance of rapid psychiatric evaluation. Because risks may be different between regions, these trained professionals were asked to identify regional risk factors for suicide in their province and the sources of support for people with suicidal thoughts or attempts. For this purpose, “Provincial Committees for Suicide Prevention” were established under the coordination of each Provincial Health Directorate. Members of the committees are representatives of the Provincial Security Directorate, Provincial Gendarmerie Command, Provincial Directorate of Family, Labour and Social Services, Provincial Mufti Office, Provincial Directorate of National Education, the municipality and NGOs. These committees work in collaboration with all units that can provide services in the field. By the end of 2018, all provinces have developed their own Suicide Prevention Provincial Action Plans to implement activities effectively. Activities are reported to the Ministry of Health twice a year. Examples of activities include the adaptation of the WHO suicide prevention resource booklets to Turkish context in 2015. The booklets are used throughout the country in capacity-building training given to five separate professions: family physicians, primary care nurses, teachers, journalists, and prison employees. Since 2015, the training has been provided to  155 426 people. The Ministry of Health has been successful in ensuring mutual cooperation between law enforcement, academics, NGOs and health professionals. This has included the development of training for police staff who have a primary role in suicide prevention in the country.\n",

It involves close collaboration with the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and the Coroners Court of Queensland (CCQ). Because of the need for real-time information, AISRAP established an interim QSR (iQSR) in 2011.The QSR contains a broad range of information on suicides in Queensland since 1990. Information comes from four primary sources, including police reports of death to a coroner, postmortem autopsies, toxicology reports and coroners’ findings. AISRAP receives the police forms from the QPS and the CCQ. AISRAP accesses the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) to obtain the other reports. Additional cross-checks occur with the Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. Each suspected suicide is entered in two stages, resulting in the iQSR and the QSR. In the first stage, information from electronic police reports for all suspected suicides is added to the iQSR three times a week. In the second stage, a coronial investigation finishes and cases close in the NCIS and then move from the iQSR to the QSR with additional information from different reports being entered and double-checked by trained research assistants.Using a decision-tree, QSR staff code all deaths into one of four probabilities: unlikely, possible, probable or beyond reasonable doubt. Only deaths falling into the categories of probable or beyond reasonable doubt are reported.\n",

      "Awareness-raising, financial investment and the inclusion of suicide prevention in the health agenda were key ingredients of success in Brazil’s surveillance of intentional injuries which is integrated to the country’s Violence and Accident Surveillance System. In 2006 the Brazilian Ministry of Health launched a ministerial ordinance (Portaria 1.876, August 2006) which established national guidelines for suicide prevention to be implemented in all levels of governance (federal, state, municipality). From 2006 to 2008, the Ministry of Health implemented the Violence and Accidents Surveillance System, including mandatory reporting of self-injuries by emergency and specialized services (e.g. women’ s centres or reference centres for violence) as well as funding for implementing the surveillance system at state and municipality levels. In 201 1, the Ministry of Health launched a new ministerial ordinance that makes surveillance reporting of self-injuries and suicide attempts mandatory for all health services (not only specialized and emergency services), and established criteria and responsibilities for health professionals and health services. In 2014, the Ministry of Health launched a new ministerial ordinance that obliged municipalities’  health secretaries to report suicide attempts within 24 hours. In 2019, a law was passed that established the National Policy for the Prevention of Self-mutilation and Suicide, to be implemented by the federal government in cooperation with the States, the Federal District and the municipalities.\n",

The purpose of the observatory is to have official and timely epidemiological information that allows for characterization of suicidal behaviour in countries in order to strengthen national capacities for decision-making on the creation and design of evidence-based plans and programmes.Mortality data in Latin America have been described as “irregular”, especially when compared with data from European countries (Bertolote & Fleischmann, 2002). There are additional problems, of which one of the most significant is the delay in reporting data (PAHO, 2014). On the other hand, there are marked disparities in suicide rates between different countries, even between some with similar levels of development (Liu, 2009), which probably reflect problems of method (P AHO, 2016). The proposal to establish a Subregional Observatory of Suicidal Behaviour was made in order to strengthen the information systems in mental health and to improve the analysis of problems and decision-making based on reliable epidemiological data. Data on completed suicides has been collected from the beginning but has recently been extended to include data on suicide attempts.\n",

      "The Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) is a 700-bedded private teaching hospital centrally located in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city with a population of approximately 22 million. The hospital uses the hospital information and management system (HIMS) for its medical records. The hospital receives an average of 60-65 cases of self-harm annually. Self-harm cases consist of three groups: medically serious attempts that are admitted to the hospital; those discharged after medical treatment in the emergency room; and those who leave against medical advice (LAMA). All self-harm patients are referred to the on- call psychiatry team for evaluation and details are documented in the patients’  medical records. Training workshops are held periodically for medical, psychiatry and nursing staff on the assessment and recording of vital information of self-harm cases.In 1990, the Department of Psychiatry set up a registry for cases of self-harm presenting to AKUH. Data are retrieved from the medical records and recorded on a specially devised data extraction form (including details of sociodemographics, methods used, type of substance, accessibility, intent, reason for self-harm, psychiatric diagnosis, disposal and follow-up) and are entered into a computerized database by a research officer. Quarterly meetings are held to review the data and quality of the database. Currently, most of the information is captured electronically.Although AKUH receives a relatively small number of self-harm cases that take place in Karachi, the database has provided useful information on the pattern of self-harm and has led to several publications. Some of the seminal research findings on self-harm in Pakistan are the result of information generated by the AKUH self-harm management system (SHMS) database (e.g. high rates of self-harm in young married women, low rates of repetition of self-harm or suicide, high use of benzodiazepines, low use of analgesics in acts of self-harm) (Khan & Reza, 1998; Syed & Kahn, 2008; Zakiullah et al., 2008).Some critical factors contributing to the sustainability of the monitoring system include departmental leadership, the presence of a dedicated research person, training and education of medical and nursing staff, documentation and medical record-keeping, information systems and quality control.The AKUH-SHMS remains the only database for self-harm in the country and provides an excellent example of a low-cost, low-resource intensive health facility-based system on data collected routinely. This is particularly useful for low- and middle-income countries that lack national surveillance systems for self-harm.\n",

Over the following years, the pesticide suicide rate fell dramatically, from 6.3 per 100 000 in 1996 to 2.2 per 100 000 in 2014 – a 65.1% reduction (Chowdhury et al., 2018). As rates of death by hanging stayed the same during this period, it appears that these bans reduced the overall number of suicides. At the same time, there was no evidence that these focused insecticide bans had any effect on agricultural output.Box 67. Limiting access to means in the community, Canada\n",
      "In the community of La Ronge in the northern part of the province of Saskatchewan (Canada), the means safety working group is implementing medication safety programming throughout the community as a strategy to restrict access to lethal means of suicide. Taking a multifaceted approach, the community coordinator in La Ronge is adapting a booklet on Creating a Safer Home with local support information; offering virtual education programming in partnership with the local pharmacist; and distributing medication lockboxes to persons identified as being at higher risk for suicide. The medication lockboxes are distributed by clinicians at key health service sites in the community to caregivers of persons who have experienced thoughts of suicide or a suicide attempt. Lessons learned in La Ronge are directly supporting communities elsewhere in Saskatchewan where local coordinators are adapting the programme to fit the needs in their own communities. Moving forward, the means safety working group in La Ronge has identified alcohol use as another important area to explore for means safety programming in the future.\n",

      "The Government of Fiji implemented a ban on the importation, sale and use of two types of pesticides (paraquat and imidacloprid) from 1 January 2020. Paraquat has been linked to a number of suicides in Fiji and has been shown to have a negative impact on the environment. Government buy-in was essential for the pesticide ban to be passed. The importance of the ban was highlighted to the government through: 1) a multisectoral approach combining the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health and organic farming NGOs to showcase reasons behind the ban; and 2) leveraging media coverage of suicide to showcase the importance of the ban.The Ministry of Health National Committee on Suicide Prevention petitioned for restriction of pesticides to prevent suicides. The Ministry of Agriculture recommended the pesticides bans due to the negative impacts on the environment (animals, waters supply, human health). At the same time, NGOs and communities pushed for organic farming using natural pesticides in Fiji because of the negative impact of paraquat and imidacloprid on the land. Looking after land and environment is integral to the Fijian identity and culture.Media coverage was used to highlight the importance of suicide prevention, and hence the ban on pesticides. Media coverage included campaigns on suicide prevention led by the National Committee on Suicide Prevention, personal stories of suicide shared by high-ranking community members over social media, and police force data on suicides.Resistance to the ban was seen from farmers who regularly used these pesticides, and sellers of the pesticides. To overcome these barriers, the Ministry of Agriculture and NGOs involved in organic farming engaged directly with farmers and sellers to educate them on the dangers of these pesticides and where to find alternatives. Awareness-raising focused on the benefits to climate change and health. To allow farmers and sellers time to adjust to the impending changes, advocacy work began six months before the ban came into practice.The top-down nature of the government ban meant that the ban is adhered to, emphasizing the importance of government buy-in.“We cannot do it alone, in isolation” Ms Tavaita Sorovanalagi Matakaca, National Suicide Prevention Project Officer, Ministry of Health, Fiji.The National Committee on Suicide Prevention has used this opportunity to promote mental well-being as a way to prevent suicides (e.g. raising community awareness of managing stress). The government is monitoring the numbers of suicides in the country to assess the impact of the pesticide ban. Initial data from January–May 2020 suggested a slight decrease in suicide rates when compared to 2019.\n",

Paraquat is a herbicide that is associated with particularly high lethality when ingested as there is no antidote or effective treatment for paraquat poisoning. Paraquat poisoning rates had increased 5.5 times by 2015 compared to rates in 2006 when restricted use was allowed after the initial decision to ban paraquat in 2002 (Leong et al, 2018). Real-world implementation of a ban on paraquat to reduce access to lethal pesticides requires addressing the accessibility of sustainable alternatives to paraquat in farming communities.\n",

The WHO publication on Preventing suicide: a resource for media professionals was translated into the Slovenian language. The working group collaborated with media professionals to gather feedback on the usefulness and clarity of the text and the guideline was further adapted to include their feedback. The working group released the final version of the Slovenian media guidelines on W orld Suicide Prevention Day (2010) at a launch event that included prominent media professionals. Dissemination was coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health. Media representatives from each health region of Slovenia were invited to be advocates for the guidelines, and local media representatives were encouraged to attend 90-minute training workshops. These workshops aimed to facilitate an exchange of opinions between suicide prevention experts and the media rather than adopting a confrontational or didactic-expert approach. Copies of the guidelines were also sent to media associations which were asked to disseminate them to their members.A research study was designed to evaluate whether the intervention (the guideline and workshops) was effective in improving the quality of reporting on suicide (Roškar et al., 2017). Print media articles were retrieved via a media monitoring agency over two 12-month periods – one prior to the introduction of the guidelines, and one following their dissemination. Articles were assessed for the presence of key qualitative indicators of responsible reporting based on the guidelines. The study found that the overall number of suicide-related articles had significantly decreased following the intervention. For six out of the 11 recommendations in the guideline, significant changes were observed in the expected direction. However, no significant reductions were seen in reporting of the method and location of suicide, and there was some increase in the use of inappropriate photographic material. The researchers suggested that in future promotion of the guidelines would benefit from workshops with editors, journalists and photographers separately in order to meet their different needs and work demands.\n",

The programme was based on: 1) a register of suicide attempters in emergency departments; 2) provision of continuity of care by following up the attempters by telephone and providing brief counselling; and 3) encouraging persons who have attempted suicide to use the mental health services. As a first step a steering committee was formed with participation of the Police Department, the Welfare Organization, a representative of the Women’s Department of the Office of the President of Iran, the Legal Medicine Department, the Iranian Scientific Society for Suicide Prevention (IRSSP) as an NGO, the Television Governing Organization and the Education Department. The steering committee was led by Ministry of Health’s mental health bureau. The IRSSP was responsible for conducting the programme in the Health and Treatment Department of the WA Medical University. At provincial level a steering committee had similar representation with each participant having their own duties in the WA province. Each participant had his/her own responsibilities regarding raising public awareness through the television organization, providing social support through the Welfare Organization, and providing security for suicidal persons. The Legal Medicine Department provided real-time data on cases of suicide, the Education Department referred students who were screened positive for self-harm behaviours, and the Health and Treatment Department had the main role in the programme, registering cases, following up and providing brief counselling.

Recovery assistants work in part-time jobs or as volunteers in NGOs. In accordance with the Regulation of the Minister of Health of 2019, recovery assistants can be employed as part of the core activities of mental health centres throughout Poland. Recovery assistants work in inpatient and outpatient clinics, community treatment teams, patients’  self- help clubs and family support groups, and are organized through the Association of Recovery Assistants (Stowarzyszenie Asystentów Zdrowienia). The role of a recovery assistant is to support the person’s recovery process. In the mental health centres, recovery assistants participate in meetings and psychotherapy sessions, support patients, and accompany them during community visits (including as part of mobile outreach teams). They also empower people in problem-solving, daily functioning tasks, accessing social support and supporting others with their own interests and passions. Recovery assistants are peer role-models who can strengthen the sense of healing during the recovery process. They are trained to refer patients to specialists when required. Recovery assistants also play a role in awareness-raising and advocacy by providing training, doing public speaking and media interviews, engaging with employers, participating in research projects, and advocating to decision-makers on behalf of mental health services.\n",
